Indications and Limitations of Coverage A. Mechanical/Hydraulic Incontinence Control Devices
Mechanical/hydraulic incontinence control devices are accepted as safe and effective in the management of urinary incontinence in patients with permanent anatomic and neurologic dysfunctions of the bladder. This class of devices achieves control of urination by compression of the urethra. The materials used and the success rate may vary somewhat

from device to device. Such a device is covered when its use is reasonable and necessary for
the individual patient. B. Collagen Implant
A collagen implant, which is injected into the submucosal tissues of the urethra and/or the
bladder neck and into tissues adjacent to the urethra, is a prosthetic device used in the
treatment of stress urinary incontinence resulting from intrinsic sphincter deﬁciency (ISD).
ISD is a cause of stress urinary incontinence in which the urethral sphincter is unable to
contract and generate sufﬁcient resistance in the bladder, especially during stress
maneuvers.
Prior to collagen implant therapy, a skin test for collagen sensitivity must be administered
and evaluated over a 4 week period.
In male patients, the evaluation must include a complete history and physical examination
and a simple cystometrogram to determine that the bladder ﬁlls and stores properly. The patient then is asked to stand upright with a full bladder and to cough or otherwise exert
abdominal pressure on his bladder. If the patient leaks, the diagnosis of ISD is established.
In female patients, the evaluation must include a complete history and physical examination
(including a pelvic exam) and a simple cystometrogram to rule out abnormalities of bladder compliance and abnormalities of urethral support. Following that determination, an
abdominal leak point pressure (ALLP) test is performed. Leak point pressure, stated in cm H2O, is deﬁned as the intra-abdominal pressure at which leakage occurs from the bladder
(around a catheter) when the bladder has been ﬁlled with a minimum of 150 cc ﬂuid. If the patient has an ALLP of less than 100 cm H2O, the diagnosis of ISD is established.
To use a collagen implant, physicians must have urology training in the use of a cystoscope and must complete a collagen implant training program.
Coverage of a collagen implant, and the procedure to inject it, is limited to the following
types of patients with stress urinary incontinence due to ISD:
Male or female patients with congenital sphincter weakness secondary to conditions
such as myelomeningocele or epispadias; Male or female patients with acquired sphincter weakness secondary to spinal cord
lesions; Male patients following trauma, including prostatectomy and/or radiation; and
Female patients without urethral hypermobility and with abdominal leak point pressures
of 100 cm H2O or less.
Patients whose incontinence does not improve with 5 injection procedures (5 separate treatment sessions) are considered treatment failures, and no further treatment of urinary

incontinence by collagen implant is covered. Patients who have a reoccurrence of
incontinence following successful treatment with collagen implants in the past (e.g., 6-12 months previously) may beneﬁt from additional treatment sessions. Coverage of additional
sessions may be allowed but must be supported by medical justiﬁcation.
