CG-SURG-01 Colonoscopy
Clinical UM Guideline
Subject: Colonoscopy
Guideline #: CG-SURG-01
Publish Date: 10/01/2025
Status: Reviewed
Last Review Date: 08/07/2025
Description
This document addresses colonoscopy, an endoscopic procedure which allows direct visual inspection of the entire colon and rectum. Additionally, biopsy or excision of polyps or other abnormalities are possible during the colonoscopy procedure.
Colonoscopy must be distinguished from CT colonography, an imaging procedure that provides indirect visualization of the colon and rectum using CT scans. This document does not address CT Colonography.
Clinical Indications
Note: The parenthetical numbers in the Clinical Indications section refer to the source documents cited in the References section below.
I. Screening and Surveillance Colonoscopy
Medically Necessary:
A. Screening Colonoscopy in Average Risk Populations (that is, asymptomatic individuals without specific risk
factors including no personal history of adenomas, sessile serrated polyps [SSPs], colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or cystic fibrosis, and no family history of colorectal cancer).
1. Colonoscopy to detect colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps is appropriate:
a. Beginning at age 45 years; (13, 22, 24, 29, 38, 40, 45) and b. Every 10 years thereafter. (11, 22, 24, 38, 40, 45)
or
2. For individuals with a personal history of a hyperplastic, non-sessile serrated polyp (non-SSP) removed at colonoscopy, measuring less than 1 cm and in the rectum and sigmoid only, the first follow up colonoscopy is appropriate in 10 years; (15, 18, 21) or
3. For individuals with a personal history of a negative stool-based test:
a. If prior screening was conducted using a guaiac-based or an immunohistochemical test, re-
screening may be performed with colonoscopy in 1 year; (21) or
b. If prior screening test was conducted using Cologuard, re-screening may be performed using
colonoscopy in 3 years.
B. Surveillance Colonoscopy in At-Risk Populations
1. Individuals who have a personal history of a positive stool based (guaiac-based, immunohistochemical or Cologuard fecal DNA) test and the confirmatory colonoscopy was positive for cancer or pre-cancerous polyp, surveillance may be appropriate based on clinical findings. (21)
2. Colorectal Cancer:
a. For those with a personal history of colorectal cancer that has been resected with curative intent,
colonoscopy is appropriate for any of the following:
i. To rule out synchronous neoplasms; no less than 3 months after cancer resection, if no unresectable metastases are found during surgery. Alternatively, colonoscopy can be performed intraoperatively, or preoperatively if non-obstructing tumor; (2, 14, 15, 21, 29) or ii. 1 year after the curative resection if a complete preoperative colonoscopy was performed, or no less than 3 months after curative resection if there was no or incomplete preoperative

colonoscopy, or 1 year following the colonoscopy that was performed to clear the colon of synchronous disease; (2, 14, 15, 21, 30) or
iii. No less than 2 years after the “1 year” follow up colonoscopy, if examination was normal; (2,
3, 14, 15, 21, 30) and
iv. For this specific group, colonoscopy may be repeated thereafter at an interval of no less
than 3 years, based on previous findings; (2, 3, 14, 15, 21, 30) or
b. For those with a personal history of stage IV colorectal cancer that was managed nonoperatively
with complete clinical response:
i. Begin colonoscopy surveillance from the first documented complete response. (21) and ii. For this specific group, colonoscopy may be repeated thereafter based on clinical judgement
(21).
3. Adenomatous Polyps or Sessile Serrated Polyps (SSP): Those who have a personal history of one or more
adenomatous polyps or SSPs removed at colonoscopy are managed according to the findings (that is, considering number of polyps and pathology). Colonoscopy may be appropriate in any of the following:
a. For those with 1 or 2 small (less than 1 cm) tubular adenomas or SSPs without cytologic dysplasia,
the first follow-up colonoscopy is appropriate in no less than 5 years; (2, 11, 15, 18, 21) or
b. For individuals with a history of any of the following, the first follow-up colonoscopy is appropriate 3
years after the initial polypectomy:
i. 3 to 9 adenomatous polyps and/or SSPs; (11, 21, 22) or ii. Any adenoma or SSP greater than or equal to 1 cm; (11, 21) or iii. Any adenoma with villous or tubulovillous features; (11, 21) or iv. Any adenoma with high-grade dysplasia; (11, 21) or v. Any SSP with cytologic dysplasia; (2, 11, 15, 18, 21)
or
c. For those with 10 or more adenomas on a single examination, the first follow-up colonoscopy is
appropriate less than 3 years after the initial polypectomy based on clinical judgment; (2, 15, 18, 22) or
d. For those with a malignant adenoma (with invasive cancer), a large sessile adenoma, or an incomplete colonoscopy, a short interval between the initial and follow up colonoscopy is appropriate based on clinical judgment; or
e. For those with sessile adenomas that are removed piecemeal, the first follow-up colonoscopy is
appropriate at no less than 2 months to verify complete removal. (2, 15, 21, 26) Note: The timing of the subsequent colonoscopy is dependent upon the pathology and the number of adenomas detected at the "follow-up colonoscopy.” For example, if the first "follow-up colonoscopy" is normal or only 1 or 2 small (less than 1cm) tubular adenomas are found, then the next colonoscopy can be in 10 years. (21)
4. Serrated Polyposis Syndrome (SPS)
a. For individuals with serrated polyposis syndrome, colonoscopy is appropriate as follows:
i. Colonoscopy with polypectomy until all polyps greater than or equal to 5 mm are removed;
(22) and
ii. Then colonoscopy no less than every year depending on the number and size of polyps.
(22).
5. Colonic Adenomatous Polyposis of Unknown Etiology: For individuals with a personal history of colonic
adenomatous polyposis of unknown etiology (without known APC or biallelic MUTYH mutations), colonoscopy is appropriate as follows:
a. For those with a personal history of more than 10 but less than 100 small (less than 1 cm)
adenomas which are manageable by colonoscopy and polypectomy, colonoscopy is appropriate no less than every year. Repeat colonoscopy performed at a shorter interval is appropriate if residual polyps are present. (22)
6. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (chronic ulcerative colitis or Crohn's colitis) and related conditions: a. For individuals with inflammatory bowel disease, colonoscopy is appropriate as follows: i. Surveillance colonoscopy beginning no less than 8 years after onset of colitis, and repeated
no less than 1 year thereafter; (2, 8, 15, 21) or
ii. For those with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), begin surveillance colonoscopy at the
time of diagnosis and then undergo yearly colonoscopy thereafter; (8, 21, 31) or
iii. When individual has undergone endoscopic resection of a visible dysplastic lesion, the next
surveillance colonoscopy should occur at 3-6 months. (17, 20)

7. Cystic Fibrosis: Research has shown an increased risk of colorectal cancer in individuals with cystic
fibrosis. Studies have also demonstrated that individuals with cystic fibrosis who underwent transplant had a higher incidence of digestive tract tumors:
a. For individuals with a personal history of cystic fibrosis and no history of solid organ transplant:
i. Colonoscopy beginning at age 40; (22) and ii. Rescreening in 5 years if colonoscopy report is normal; (22) or iii. Repeat in 3 years if colonoscopy reports adenomatous polyps; (22)
or
b. For individuals with a personal history of cystic fibrosis and a solid organ transplant:
i. Colonoscopy beginning at age 30 years; (22) or within 2 years of the transplantation; and ii. Rescreening in 5 years if colonoscopy report is normal; or iii. Repeat in 3 years if colonoscopy reports adenomatous polyps. 8. Increased Risk Based on Personal History of Childhood, Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer:
a. For individuals with a personal history of childhood, or adolescent and young adult cancer (age 15-
39 years at the time of initial cancer diagnosis) treated with chemotherapy (without radiation therapy):
i. Colonoscopy beginning at age 35; (22) or ii. 10 years after age of chemotherapy, (whichever comes first); (22) and iii. For this specific group, colonoscopy may be repeated every 5 years. (22)
or
b. For individuals with a personal history of childhood, adolescent or young adult cancer treated with
radiation of the abdominopelvic field, (that is, abdomen, pelvis, spine [lumbar, sacral, whole] or total body irradiation [TBI]), (with or without chemotherapy);
i. Colonoscopy beginning at age 30; (22, 44) or ii. 5 years after treatment (whichever occurs last); (22, 44) and iii. For this specific group, colonoscopy may be repeated every 5 years. (22, 44)
C. Screening Colonoscopy in Higher Risk Populations
1. Family History of Colorectal Cancer or Adenomas: The vast majority of those with increased risk are in this
category. Screening colonoscopy is appropriate for a person with a family history indicating any of the following:
a. One first degree relative (parent, sibling or child) with colorectal cancer diagnosed at any age; (2,
18, 22, 29, 45)
i. Colonoscopy beginning at age 40; (2, 18, 22, 29, 45) or ii. Colonoscopy beginning at an age 10 years younger than the age at diagnosis of the
youngest affected relative, whichever comes first; (2, 18, 22, 29, 45) and
iii. For this specific group, colonoscopy may be repeated no less than every 3 years depending
on findings; (2, 18, 22) or
b. One second and one third-degree relative with colorectal cancer at any age;
i. Colonoscopy beginning at age 45; (22) and ii. For this specific group, colonoscopy may be repeated every 10 years, depending on
findings; (22) or
c. One first-degree relative with confirmed advanced adenoma(s) (for example, high-grade dysplasia, greater than or equal to 1 cm, villous or tubulovillous histology, traditional serrated adenoma [TSA]) or advanced SSPs/SSLs (greater than or equal to 1 cm, dysplasia) at any age:
i. Colonoscopy beginning at age 40 or at age of onset of adenoma in affected relative,
whichever is first; (21, 22) and
ii. For this specific group, colonoscopy may be repeated no less than every 5 years, or if
positive, repeat per colonoscopy findings. (21, 22) Note: Increased numbers of affected first-degree relatives influences risk much more than affected second-degree relatives or third-degree relatives. However, when combined with a positive first-degree family history, a positive second- and third-degree family history can significantly increase risk. (21)
2. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP): In this autosomal dominant syndrome, affected persons have a risk of colorectal cancer approaching 100%. The average age of adenoma appearance is 16, and the average age of colon cancer is 39. Most affected individuals develop more than 100 adenomas. Thus early and regular screening is appropriate for any of the following. (2; 46) 3/13
2. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP): In this autosomal dominant syndrome, affected persons have a risk of colorectal cancer approaching 100%. The average age of adenoma appearance is 16, and the average age of colon cancer is 39. Most affected individuals develop more than 100 adenomas. Thus early and regular screening is appropriate for any of the following. (2; 46) 3/13

CG-SURG-01 Colonoscopy
a. For those with a genetic diagnosis of FAP or who are at risk for this diagnosis but genetic testing
has not been done or is not feasible:
i. Offer genetic counseling, as specific genetic abnormalities can be identified in approximately 80% of affected individuals. This can then be used to screen other family members; (29, 46) and
ii. Annual colonoscopy beginning at an age no less than 10 years; (2, 22) and
a. With an appropriately timed colectomy indicated when polyps develop; (2, 22, 29, 46)
or
b. If no polyps develop, colonoscopy every 2 years until age 20 then surveillance
colonoscopy per clinical guidance (46). or
b. For the family members of those with FAP who do not have specific genetic evidence or clinical
manifestations of the disease:
i. In the older, unscreened relatives of a person newly diagnosed with FAP, colonoscopy is
appropriate for the first screening examination; (23) and
ii. Annual screening sigmoidoscopy until age 40 if no polyps develop; (23) and iii. An appropriately timed colectomy indicated if polyps develop. (8, 23)
Note: While the above is applicable to individuals with FAP and their families, there are variants of this syndrome, attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli (AAPC) (also referred to as attenuated FAP) and MYH-associated polyposis. The genetic mutations leading to these variants differ from that in the typical FAP individual. These variants are associated with a variable number of adenomas (usually 20 to 100), a tendency toward right sided lesions, and an age of onset of colorectal cancer that is approximately 10 years later than for others with FAP. As with FAP, genetic counseling for these individuals and early and regular screening is warranted. It is recommended that this screening begin in the late teens or early 20s, depending on the age of polyp expression in the family. (35)
3. Lynch Syndrome, also known as Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC): For individuals with a genetic or clinical diagnosis of, or who are at increased risk for Lynch Syndrome, colonoscopy is appropriate as follows: a. For individuals who are MLH1, MSH2 and EPCAM mutation carriers:
i. No less than every year beginning at an age no less than 20 years old or no less than 2
years prior to the earliest colon cancer in a first-degree relative if it is diagnosed before age 25; (10, 23) or
b. For individuals who are MSH6 and PMS2 mutation carriers:
i. No less than every year beginning at an age no less than 25 years old or no less than 2
years prior to the earliest colon cancer in a first-degree relative if it is diagnosed before age 30. (23)
4. Serrated Polyposis Syndrome (SPS)
a. For individuals with a family history of serrated polyposis syndrome, colonoscopy is appropriate in the first-degree relative of the individual with serrated polyposis syndrome at the earliest of the following:
i. Age 40; (23) or ii. Same age as the youngest diagnosis of serrated polyposis if uncomplicated by cancer; (23)
or
iii. Ten years earlier than earliest diagnosis in family of colorectal cancer complicating serrated
polyposis: (23)
a. Following baseline exam, repeat colonoscopy every 5 years if no polyps are found;
(23) or
b. If proximal serrated polyps or multiple adenomas are found, consider colonoscopy no
less than every year. (23)
5. Colonic Adenomatous Polyposis of Unknown Etiology: For individuals with a family history of colonic adenomatous polyposis of unknown etiology (without known APC or biallelic MUTYH mutations), colonoscopy is appropriate as follows: a. Individual with a first-degree relative diagnosed with 100 or more adenomas prior to age 40 years:
i. Colonoscopy beginning at an age no less than 10 years; (23) and ii. Every 1 year until age 24 years; (23) and iii. Every 2 years from age 24 to 34 years; (23) and iv. Every 3 years from age 34 to 44 years; (23) and

CG-SURG-01 Colonoscopy
Discussion/General Information
Summary
Colonoscopy involves the insertion of a colonoscope (a thin, flexible fiberoptic tube with a camera) through the anus to visualize the lining of the rectum and colon to detect abnormalities such as inflammation, polyps, or cancer. In the United States, colonoscopy is the gold standard test for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in individuals who are not at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. Screening colonoscopy is essential to detect and treat early CRCs. Colonoscopy can be used as a diagnostic tool to investigate signs or symptoms of colorectal disease and in individuals who had positive results following another colorectal cancer screening test. Colonoscopy can also be used to monitor (surveil) the colon and rectum following the identification and surgical removal of cancerous or precancerous growths, as well as other conditions affecting the colon and rectum.
Screening, surveillance, and diagnostic indications for colonoscopy are based on guidelines from a variety of specialty societies and governmental organizations. The source for each of the indications listed above is indicated by the referenced citation.
Discussion
Generally speaking, screening refers to an effort or program which is used to detect a condition in an asymptomatic individual so that early detection and treatment can be provided for those who test positive for the condition. Surveillance refers to the systematic identification and evaluation of individuals considered to be at increased risk for the occurrence or recurrence of a condition or disease (for example; colorectal cancer or adenomatous polyps. Diagnostic testing is typically done to confirm or rule out a condition in an individual who is symptomatic or who, for some other reason, is believed to have a specific condition.
Multiple specialty medical societies have published recommendations for colorectal cancer screening and provided guidance on when colorectal cancer screening should be initiated. The American Cancer Society (ACS), American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (ASCRS), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), U. S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and U.S. Multi-Society Task Force of Colorectal Cancer (USMSTF), which represents the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), all recommend that individuals at average risk for colorectal cancer begin screening at 45 years of age. The repeat testing interval for individuals considered at average risk for CRC cancer is every 10 years. The USPSTF and the AGA have issued recommendations regarding the appropriate age to discontinue CRC screening. The USPSTF concluded that for individuals 76 to 85 years of age, the benefits of screening for CRC diminish while the risk of experiencing serious associated harms increase. Therefore, the decision to screen for CRC in individuals between 76 and 85 years of age “should be an individual one, taking into account the patient’s overall health and prior screening history”. For this group, the USPSTF has indicated that “screening would be most appropriate among adults who (1) are healthy enough to undergo treatment if colorectal cancer is detected and (2) do not have comorbid conditions that would significantly limit their life expectancy”. The USPSTF recommends against the use of CRC screening in adults 85 years of age or older (USPSTF, 2021). In a similar manner, the AGA recommends that the decision to continue CRC screening in individuals older than 75 years be individualized, based on an assessment of risks, benefits, screening history, and comorbidities (ACS, 2024; Hardiman, 2021; Issaka, 2023; NCCN CRC, 2024; Patel, 2022; USPSTF, 2021; Wolf, 2018).
Colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for colon cancer surveillance. Surveillance intervals (which provide guidance on how frequently a colonoscopy should be repeated), are based upon the individual's risk factors (for example, the individual’s personal medical history, family history of CRC and the results of earlier colonoscopies). Surveillance with earlier and more frequent colonoscopy is recommended for individuals who are at increased risk for CRC.
Due to advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, multigene tests which simultaneously analyze a set of genes that are associated with a specific family cancer phenotype or multiple phenotypes are being explored as a means to create colonoscopy surveillance recommendations. With regards to using multigene testing to develop colonoscopy surveillance recommendations, the NCCN has indicated it “recognizes that data to support the surveillance recommendations for these particular genes are evolving at this time” and that “caution should be used when implementing final colonoscopy surveillance regimens in context of patient preferences and new knowledge that may emerge” (NCCN, Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment Colorectal, 2023).

Federal and State law, as well as contract language, and Medical Policy take precedence over Clinical UM Guidelines. We reserve the right to review and update Clinical UM Guidelines periodically. Clinical guidelines approved by the Medical Policy & Technology Assessment Committee are available for general adoption by plans or lines of business for consistent review of the medical necessity of services related to the clinical guideline when the plan performs utilization review for the subject. Due to variances in utilization patterns, each plan may choose whether to adopt a particular Clinical UM Guideline. To determine if review is required for this Clinical UM Guideline, please contact the customer service number on the member's card.
Alternatively, commercial or FEP plans or lines of business which determine there is not a need to adopt the guideline to review services generally across all providers delivering services to Plan’s or line of business’s members may instead use the clinical guideline for provider education and/or to review the medical necessity of services for any provider who has been notified that his/her/its claims will be reviewed for medical necessity due to billing practices or claims that are not consistent with other providers, in terms of frequency or in some other manner.
