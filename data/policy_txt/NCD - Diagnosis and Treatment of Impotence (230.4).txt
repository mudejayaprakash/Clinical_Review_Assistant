NCD - Diagnosis and Treatment of Impotence (230.4)
Impotence is a failure of a body part for which the diagnosis, and frequently the treatment,
require medical expertise. Depending on the cause of the condition, treatment may be
surgical; e.g., implantation of a penile prosthesis, or nonsurgical; e.g., medical or
psychotherapeutic treatment.
Indications and Limitations of Coverage
Program payment may be made for diagnosis and treatment of sexual impotence. Since
causes and, therefore, appropriate treatment vary, if abuse is suspected it may be necessary
to request documentation of appropriateness in individual cases. If treatment is furnished to
patients (other than hospital inpatients) in connection with a mental condition, apply the
psychiatric service limitation described in the Medicare General Information, Eligibility, and
Entitlement Manual
, Chapter 3.
