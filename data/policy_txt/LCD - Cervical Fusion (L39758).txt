Provider Qualiﬁcations
The Medicare Program Integrity Manual states services will be considered reasonable and necessary only if performed by appropriately trained providers.
Patient safety and quality of care mandate that healthcare professionals who perform cervical fusion are appropriately trained and credentialed by a formal residency/fellowship program. Credentialing or privileges are required for procedures performed in inpatient and outpatient settings.
All aspects of care must be within the provider’s medical licensure and scope of practice. Reimbursement for procedures utilizing imaging techniques may be made to providers who meet training requirements for the procedures in this policy only if their respective state allows such in their practice act and formally licenses or certiﬁes the practitioner to use and interpret these imaging modalities (ionizing radiation and associated contrast material, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound). At a minimum, training must cover and develop an understanding of anatomy and drug pharmacodynamics and kinetics as well as proﬁciency in diagnosis and management of disease, the technical performance of the procedure, and utilization of the required associated imaging modalities.
Notice: Services performed for any given diagnosis must meet all the indications and limitations stated in this LCD, the general requirements for medical necessity as stated in CMS payment policy manuals, all existing CMS national coverage determinations, and all Medicare payment rules.

Contractor Advisory Meeting
A Multi-MAC Contractor Advisory Committee (CAC) Meeting was hosted by Noridian and included Noridian Healthcare Solutions, CGS Administrators, National Government Services, Palmetto GBA, WPS Government Health Administrators, First Coast Service Options and Novitas Solutions on August 16, 2023. The transcript and audio for this meeting is posted on each MACs website. Feedback from the subject matter experts is included through the evidence summary.
Summary of Evidence
Conservative Treatment
Treatment of cervical radiculopathy can range from conservative management to surgery. Conservative care is considered initial management for cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders as most cases will be self-limited and resolve spontaneously over a variable length of time without speciﬁc intervention. Conservative management for cervical radiculopathy may include oral analgesics or short course of oral glucocorticoids, avoidance of provocative activities, short term immobilization with cervical collar or pillow, active physical In a published analysis of clinical practice therapy, manual therapy, and cervical traction. guidelines for neck pain and radiculopathy the following interventions were listed as 16 recommended components of conservative therapy :

15,16
Pharmacotherapies: analgesics, Paracetamol (Acetaminophen), NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs), SNRIS, opioids (including tramadol), topical medications including NSAIDS. Non-Pharmacologic Interventions: exercise programs/physical therapy, thermotherapy, manual therapy (combined with other treatment), acupuncture, epidural steroid injection.
Studies have shown that surgery and conservative interventions achieve similar long-term results, and that conservative treatment is often the preferred option because it avoids the risks of surgical treatment. the role of conservative measures as a ﬁrst-line approach for the management of cervical radiculopathy. improve with conservative measures. was shown to be beneﬁcial for cervical radiculopathy in a systematic review and meta- analysis. randomized trial to substantially reduce neck and arm pain for patients with cervical A RCT compared cervical collar or physical therapy and found improvement radiculopathy. over a wait and see approach suggesting that an active treatment approach results in better outcomes. cervical radiculopathy had more rapid resolution of symptoms compared to those who remained in physical therapy but outcomes at 2 years were similar and conclude structured physiotherapy should be considered ﬁrst line management.

While the focus was on
Different deﬁnitions of conservative care are used e.g., “a multimodality approach consisting of a combination of active and inactive components” and “a combination of strategies to reduce inﬂammation, alleviate pain, and improve function.” All organizations require the failure of at least six weeks of conservative management.
Some organizations require conservative management within the preceding 3 or 6 months,
while others do not specify how recently conservative treatment needs to take place.
Conservative interventions are ‘provider-directed treatment’ that includes education,
activity modiﬁcation, nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory (NSAIDs), narcotic and non-narcotic
analgesic medications, oral or injectable corticosteroids, a provider-directed home
exercise/stretching program, cross-training, avoidance of aggravating activities,
physical/occupational therapy, spinal manipulation, interventional pain procedure, and
other pain management techniques. Only a single organization requires two separate forms
of conservative treatment, although the guidelines do not specify what these are.
Imaging Modalities

North American Spine Society (NASS) Evidence-Based Clinical Guidelines on the Diagnosis
and Treatment for Cervical Radiculopathy from Degenerative Disorders state MRI is the
recommended study for correlative compressive lesions in cervical spine patients who have
failed conservative therapy and being considered for intervention based on Grade B
recommendation. The consensus of the group was that CT can be considered in those who
have a contraindication to MRI. Computed tomography myelography was recommended for
patients with discordant ﬁndings on MRI or contraindication to MRI based on Grade B
Recommendation. There was insufﬁcient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the
use of electromyography (EMG) for cervical radiculopathy evaluation.
Cervical Radiculopathy
Cervical radiculopathy is a common condition that usually occurs when a nerve root is inﬂamed
by a herniated disc or bone spur. As a result, the inﬂamed nerve root may result in neck pain,

numbness or muscle weakness and sensory symptoms. This condition impacts approximately
85 out of 100,000 people.

Clinical Outcomes
Seven evidence syntheses with publication dates ranging from 2016-2022 that assessed
clinical outcomes were identiﬁed.
28-34
Two reviews included only RCTs.
28,30
Four studies
included both non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSI) and a small number (range 1-6)
of RCTs.
29,31-33
The number of primary studies in the syntheses ranged from 7-23, with
generally small sample sizes. Half the studies diagnosed participants with single-level,
unilateral cervical radiculopathy. Comparators included different fusion techniques,
foraminotomy, arthroplasty, and conservative interventions. Anterior cervical discectomy and
fusion was an intervention in each study. Timing to follow-up ranged from 24 to 47 months.
Broekema, et al. (2020)conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis that included 1,567
participants described in 21 RCTs.
28
Thirteen of the studies had data from less than 100
participants. The clinical effects of ACDF were compared with posterior cervical foraminotomy
(PCF), anterior cervical discectomy without intervertebral spacer (ACD), ACD with poly-
methylmethacrylate as an intervertebral spacer (PMMA), autologous bone graft (ABG), ACDF
with autologous bone graft plus plating (ABGP), cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA), and physical
therapy. ACDF had a signiﬁcantly better success rate compared to ACD. Among the remaining
comparisons, there were no signiﬁcant differences in success rates. Six subgroup comparisons
found no signiﬁcant differences in work status across interventions. Aside from a signiﬁcant
effect favoring ACDF over CDA, there were no differences in disability outcomes at mean
follow-up. Improvement in arm pain favored ACDF with a cage over ABGP, ACD over ACDF
with a cage, and ACDF over CDA. The clinical signiﬁcance of these differences was not
described. Limitations in this evidence synthesis included an overall high risk of bias (only 3 of
21 included studies had a low risk of bias), indirectness (the mean age across studies was 43.8 years), and imprecision due to the small sample sizes across sizes, with 62% of studies having
less than 100 participants.
Fang, et al. (2020) included 3 RCTs and 12 NRSI with a total of 52,705 (~51K from a single
cohort study) participants diagnosed with single-level unilateral cervical radiculopathy in a
systematic review with meta-analysis. Outcomes comparing ACDF with PCF were measured at
29
a mean of 47 months. No statistically signiﬁcant differences were identiﬁed for measures of disability (function), neck pain, arm pain, or satisfaction. Limitations impacting the certainty of
the evidence included inherent drawbacks due to most of the primary study designs (12 of 15
studies were retrospective cohort designs) and the 3 RCTs either did not contribute to or
contributed minimally to the pooled analyses, indirectness (the mean ages across studies
ranged from 39 to 53.8 years), and signiﬁcant heterogeneity was observed in subgroup
analyses of ACDF vs. PCF using open and minimally invasive techniques.
In a network meta-analysis, Gao, et al. (2022) performed direct and indirect comparisons of
ABG, ACD, ACF, PCF, ACDFP (ACDF plus plating), CDA, PMMA, and physical therapy.

three RCTs (N=1,844) were assessed at a mean of 26 months. There were no statistical
differences among the different interventions in measures of success rate, arm/neck pain, or
disability. There were limitations in this network meta-analysis including an overall high risk of
bias (only 13% [3 of 23] of the studies had a low risk of bias), indirectness (the mean/median age among the included studies ranged from 41 to 50.5 years and only 2 of 23 studies were
conducted within the United States), imprecision (sample sizes were small [27-209]), and
inconsistency (clinical and statistical heterogeneity).
Goedmakers, et al. (2020) systematically reviewed 6 RCTs and 2 NRSI (N=777) in comparing
ACDF with CDA.
31
Timing to follow-up in the studies ranged from 1-7 years. A single study
reported a statistically signiﬁcant difference between interventions for disability; however, the difference did not achieve clinical relevance. Another ﬁve studies found no signiﬁcant difference
between CDA and ACDF. None of the studies reported a signiﬁcant difference in neck pain after
2 years post-surgery. Limitations of this systematic review included all articles showed
intermediate to high risk of bias, indirectness (mean age was ~45 years), imprecision (sample
sizes were small [41-209]), and inconsistency (high heterogeneity precluded pooling the results
of individual studies).
A systematic review with meta-analysis of 658 patients (1 RCT; 11 NRSI) with single-level
cervical radiculopathy compared traditional ACDF vs. stand-alone ACDF vs. CDA.
32
The
reviewers found no statistically signiﬁcant differences in disability measures at a minimum of 1
year for the different interventions. Limitations included the drawbacks inherent in
observational studies (11 of 12 included studies were cohort designs), uncertainty about the
internal validity of the studies (risk of bias of the included studies was not assessed),
imprecision (the mean sample size was 54.8), and inconsistency (high heterogeneity was
present in the pooled analysis for disability outcomes).
Liu, et al. (2016) produced a systematic review of 1,336 patients with cervical radiculopathy (3
RCTs, 7 NRSI) who underwent either ACDF or PCF.
33
At a mean of 3.7 years following the
procedure, there were no between-group differences in patient-reported measures of pain and
disability. Based on a single study, ACDF showed a signiﬁcantly higher success rate (93.6%)
than the PCF group (85.1%). Limitations of this review included the drawbacks inherent in
observational studies (7 of the 10 studies were retrospective cohort designs), all the RCTs were
judged to have a high risk of bias, and indirectness (the mean age of the included participants
was ~46 years [39-53.3]).
Zou, et al. (2022) conducted a systematic review with a meta-analysis of 1,175 patients with
unilateral cervical radiculopathy.
34
One RCT and 6 NRSI compared clinical outcomes for groups
receiving ACDF or MI-PCF (minimally invasive posterior cervical fusion). At a mean post-surgical
follow-up of 47 months, no statistically signiﬁcant differences were observed in patient-
reported disability, neck pain, or arm pain. Limitations in this evidence synthesis included those
inherent in observational study designs, indirectness (the mean age of the participants was
48.9 years), and inconsistency (high heterogeneity was reported for arm pain outcomes).

LCD - Cervical Fusion (L39758)
In aggregate, the clinical effects associated with the different surgical and conservative interventions did not result in statistically signiﬁcant or clinically relevant differences. The only
exception was ACDF, which showed a better success rate than ACD. Overall, the certainty of
the evidence was determined to be very low. Limitations included those inherent in
observational study designs, high risk of bias in most RCTs, indirectness, imprecision, and
heterogeneous outcomes.
Surgical Outcomes
Three evidence syntheses reported on perioperative measures. Operative time was assessed in
all studies.
29,30,34
Length of stay (LOS) was included in two reviews.
29,34
A single study
analyzed blood loss.
29
Fang, et al. (2020) compared ACDF with open PCF or MI-PCF for patients with single-level,
unilateral cervical radiculopathy in a systematic review with meta-analysis.
29
The reviewers
reported that compared to ACDF, open PCF had a shorter operation time, while there was no
difference between ACDF and MI-PCF. Based on data from 2 studies, there was no signiﬁcant
difference in blood loss among the surgical techniques. The PCF group was associated with a
signiﬁcantly shorter length of hospitalization than the ACDF group. Limitations impacting the
certainty of the evidence included inherent drawbacks due to most of the primary study designs
(12 of 15 studies were retrospective cohort designs) and the 3 RCTs either did not contribute to
or contributed minimally to the pooled analyses, indirectness (the mean ages across studies ranged from 39 to 53.8 years), and signiﬁcant heterogeneity was observed in subgroup
analyses of ACDF vs. PCF using open and minimally invasive techniques.
Gao, et al. (2022) assessed operative time for different surgical procedures in a network meta-
analysis.
30
Direct and indirect comparisons showed ABGP, ACD, ACDF, and ACDFP had shorter
surgery times compared with ABG. ACDF had a shorter surgery time compared with PMMA.
There were limitations in this network meta-analysis including an overall high risk of bias (only 13% [3 of 23] of the studies had a low risk of bias), indirectness (the mean/median age among
the included studies ranged from 41 to 50.5 years and only 2 of 23 studies were conducted
within the United States), imprecision (sample sizes were small [27-209]), and inconsistency
(clinical and statistical heterogeneity).
Zou, et al. (2022) performed a systematic review with meta-analysis comparing ACDF with MI-
34
PCF. cohorts. Data from 3 retrospective studies observed a statistically signiﬁcant difference in LOS
The analysis did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant difference in operative time between the two
favoring MI-PCF. Limitations in this evidence synthesis included those inherent in observational
study designs, and indirectness (the mean age of the participants was 48.9 years).
In summary, the observed perioperative results varied by the comparators and the type of
outcome. Compared to open PCF, ACDF had signiﬁcantly longer operative time and LOS. MI-
PCF also had a signiﬁcantly less LOS than ACDF. When ACDF was compared to other surgical techniques, no signiﬁcant differences were found in operative time and blood loss. The overall

==================================================
PAGE 16
==================================================

10/15/25, 7:00 PM
LCD - Cervical Fusion (L39758)
certainty of the evidence was rated as very low due to the high risk of bias in the included RCTs,
limitations inherent in observational studies, and uncertainty about the applicability of the
results to the U.S. Medicare population (indirectness).
Radiographic Outcomes
Two evidence syntheses described post-surgical radiographic results associated with
individuals diagnosed with cervical radiculopathy.
32,33
Katsuura, et al. (2019) performed a systematic review with meta-analysis that compared
traditional ACDF vs. stand-alone ACDF vs. CDA.
32
At a minimum of 1-year post-surgical follow-
up, no signiﬁcant differences in the C2-C7 (Cobb) angle were observed. Limitations of this
evidence synthesis included the drawbacks inherent in observational studies (11 of 12 included
studies were cohort designs), uncertainty about the internal validity of the studies (risk of bias
of the included studies was not assessed), and imprecision (the mean sample size was 54.8).
Liu, et al. (2016) systematically reviewed data from 3 RCTs and 7 NRSI, encompassing 1,335
patients; however, only a single RCT provided data regarding radiographic outcomes.
33
The
postoperative ROM of the caudal adjacent segment was 11.33° ± 5.07° in the ACDF group and
8.73° ± 5.92° in the PCF group. The signiﬁcance of this difference was not described. Limitations
of this review included the drawbacks inherent in observational studies (seven of the ten studies
were retrospective cohort designs), all the RCTs were judged to have a high risk of bias, and
indirectness (the mean age of the included participants was ~46 years [39-53.3]).
Overall, there was limited evidence concerning radiographic outcomes following cervical fusion
in patients diagnosed with cervical radiculopathy. No signiﬁcant between-group differences
were reported for Cobb angle or ROM. The overall certainty of the evidence was judged as very
low due to a high/unknown risk of bias, study design limitations, imprecise data, and
indirectness.
Undesirable Effects
Six evidence syntheses described undesired effects associated with cervical fusion
surgery.
28,30,31,33-35
Assessment timeframes ranged from 24 to 57 months.
Broekema, et al. (2020) performed a systematic review with meta-analysis of 1,567
participants diagnosed with cervical radiculopathy who underwent anterior or posterior
surgical interventions and were compared with other surgical techniques.
28
There was a higher
complication rate in the group with ABG from the iliac crest. This effect disappeared when
donor-site complications were left out. No other signiﬁcant effect was observed in the
comparison between ACDF with ABG and ACDF with a cage. Subgroup comparisons found no
signiﬁcant differences in reoperation rate across the different surgeries. Limitations in this
evidence synthesis included an overall high risk of bias (only 3 of 21 included studies had a low
risk of bias), indirectness (the mean age across studies was 43.8 years), and imprecision due to
the small sample sizes across sizes, with 62% of studies having less than 100 participants.

Gao, et al. (2022) conducted a network meta-analysis of 23 RCTs that included direct and
indirect comparisons of ACDF, ABG, ACD, ACF, PCF, ACDFP, CDA, PMMA, and physical
therapy.
30
There were no statistical differences among the various interventions, including
physical therapy for complication and reoperation rates. There were limitations in this network
meta-analysis including an overall high risk of bias (only 13% [3 of 23] of the studies had a low
risk of bias), indirectness (the mean/median age among the included studies ranged from 41 to
50.5 years and only 2 of 23 studies were conducted within the United States), imprecision
(sample sizes were small [27-209]), and inconsistency (clinical and statistical heterogeneity).
Goedmakers, et al. (2020) systematically reviewed 777 participants with cervical radiculopathy
from 6 RCTs and 2 NRSI in comparing CDA to ACDF.
31
The authors concluded the reporting on
the level of reoperation is heterogeneous and incomplete; however, the results suggested
reoperations were most frequent at the adjacent level for the ACDF group and at the index level
for the CDA group. Four articles described adjacent segment disease (ASD), of which only one
article described a signiﬁcantly higher incidence of ASD in ACDF patients. No other statistically
signiﬁcant differences in complication rates were described between groups. Limitations of this
systematic review included all articles showed intermediate to high risk of bias, indirectness
(mean age was ~45 years), imprecision (sample sizes were small [41-209]), and inconsistency
(high heterogeneity precluded pooling the results of individual studies).
Gutman, et al. (2018) performed a systematic review with meta-analysis that focused on the
comparative undesired effects of participants with single-level cervical radiculopathy who
prospectively underwent ACDF, CDA, or MI-PCF.
35
The rate of revision surgery following ACDF
(14.46) was greater than double that of MI-PCF (7.00) and CDR (6.49). Compared to ACDF
(21.29), the rate of adverse events was signiﬁcantly less for MI-PCF (3.00), but greater for CDA
(27.27). Limitation in this review included the risk of bias of the primary studies was not
assessed, indirectness (the mean age for each of the included studies was less than 50 years
[43-49.3]), imprecision (the number of studies was few [4], with small sample sizes), and
uncertainty concerning inconsistency (heterogeneity was not assessed).
Liu, et al. (2016) assessed the overall complication rate in a systematic review that compared
patients who had received either ACDF or PCF.
33
The mean complication rate was 7% in the
ACDF group and 4% in the PCF group. The difference was not statistically signiﬁcant.
Limitations of this review included the drawbacks inherent in observational studies (seven of the
ten studies were retrospective cohort designs), all the RCTs were judged to have a high risk of
bias, and indirectness (the mean age of the included participants was ~46 years [39-53.3]).
Zou, et al. (2022) employed a systematic review with meta-analysis of 1,175 patients who
underwent either ACDF or PCF.
34
In the ACDF group, complication rates ranged between 1.8%
and 10.5%. In the MIS-PCF group, the rate was between 0% and 14.3%. The between-group
difference was not signiﬁcant. The reoperation rate was between 0-7.5% in the ACDF group
and 0 -14.3% in the MIS-PCF group. The difference was not signiﬁcant. Limitations in this

evidence synthesis included those inherent in observational study designs, and indirectness (the
mean age of the participants was 48.9 years).
In aggregate, the complication rates associated with different surgical procedures and physical
therapy are generally similar; however, the rate of adverse events with ACDF appears to be
greater than MI-PCF, and the rate of ASD is lower with CDA vs. ACDF. The overall results of the
different evidence syntheses were heterogeneous concerning reoperation rates. No signiﬁcant
differences were found among the surgical interventions studied apart from a small systematic
review (Gutman, et al.; 2018) that concluded the revision surgery rate of ACDF was double that
of CDA and MI-PCF. The credibility of these ﬁndings was very low due to a lack of quality
appraisal (risk of bias) for the included RCTs, the small numbers of studies (4) and participants
(506), uncertain applicability to the U.S. Medicare population, and omitting an assessment of
heterogeneity. Overall, the certainty of the evidence was judged to be very low due to multiple
limitations i.e., study designs, high/unclear risk of bias, indirectness, imprecise results, and
unexplained heterogeneity.
Societal Input
The North American Spine Society (NASS) has published appropriateness criteria for cervical
fusion surgery as a treatment for cervical radiculopathy.
3
Cervical radiculopathy: from degenerative disorders (either from disc herniation or bony
stenosis), as an adjunct to disc excision, that meets ALL the following criteria:
Pattern of radiculopathy explained by imaging.
Six to 12 weeks of an appropriate course of nonoperative treatment.
The following can mitigate the need for an initial nonoperative trial:
Severity of symptoms prevents the patient from working. Functionally limiting motor weakness.
Cervical fusion may NOT be indicated in cases that do not fulﬁll the above criteria including
cervical radiculopathy from isolated foraminal stenosis treated with a partial medial
facetectomy/foraminotomy.
Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy
Clinical Outcomes
Six evidence syntheses with publication dates ranging from 2014-2022 that assessed clinical
outcomes were identiﬁed.
36-41
Three of the syntheses included only non-randomized studies of
an intervention (NRSI).
37,39,40
Three studies included both NRSI and a small number (1-4) of
RCTs.
36,38,41
The number of primary studies in the syntheses ranged from 5-18, with generally
small sample sizes. Participants were mostly diagnosed with multilevel cervical spondylotic
myelopathy (CSM). Comparators included different fusion techniques, arthroplasty, and hybrid

surgery. Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion was an intervention in each study. Timing to
follow-up was variable (1-60+ months).
Fei, et al. (2015) conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis that compared two fusion
techniques, ACDF and ACCF (anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion).
36
Eighteen primary
studies (1 RCT, 17 NRSI) were included in the review. Outcomes were assessed at a minimum of
6 months post-operation. Neurological status (success) and pain intensity outcomes were
similar between surgical groups. There were several limitations in this study including those
associated with observational studies (17 of 18 studies were cohort or case-control designs),
indirectness (17 of 18 studies included participants located in China or South Korea, and all the
studies had a mean/median between 32-59 years), imprecision (all studies had small sample
sizes with conﬁdence intervals that crossed the indicator for no effect), and inconsistency of
effects across studies (signiﬁcant heterogeneity for all secondary outcomes).
In a systematic review with meta-analysis, Han, et al. (2014) reported on 14 NRSI that
compared ACDF and ACCF.
37
At a postoperative minimum of 24 months, all clinical measures
(success rate, neurological status, pain, and function [disability]) were statistically similar (p
>0.05). Limitations of this review involved the inclusion of only low-quality studies (all included
studies were observational cohort or case-control designs), indirectness (mean ages ranged
from 44-58.74 yrs.), imprecision (all studies had small sample sizes and pain outcomes had
small numbers of pooled data), and high statistical heterogeneity (inconsistency) was present
for functional outcomes.
Li, et al. (2019) performed a network meta-analysis that included 4 RCTs and 12 NRSI.
38
analysis included direct and indirect comparisons of ACDF, ACCF, cervical disc arthroplasty
[replacement] (CDA), and hybrid surgery. At a mean of 33.3 months following surgery, CDA
demonstrated a statistically signiﬁcant difference in disability outcomes compared to the other
surgical procedures. The clinical signiﬁcance of these results was not described. Limitations in
this network meta-analysis were associated with low-quality studies (12 of 16 studies were
case-control designs), indirectness (indirect comparisons were a core component of the
methodology and 14 studies took place in Asia [China, South Korea, Singapore]), and imprecision (all studies had small sample sizes).
Montano, et al. (2019) systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed 5 NRSI (487 participants)
with multilevel CSM.
39
No difference in neurological status was found between ACDF and
laminoplasty at a mean of 35.4 months post-surgery (MD = -0.053; 95% CI, -0.511 to 0.404; p =
0.819). Limitations involved the low-quality of all included studies (observational cohort or
case-control designs), indirectness (all studies had mean ages between 54 and 56.8 years.), imprecision (too few events for all outcomes and wide conﬁdence intervals for all pooled
outcomes measured).
A systematic review without meta-analysis of 11 primary studies (2 RCTs, 9 NRSI) included a
total of 570 participants with single or multilevel CSM.

ACCF were found for neurological status, pain, or function (disability). Review limitations
included the overall low-quality primary study designs (9 of the 11 included studies were
observational cohort or case-control), indirectness (none of the studies were performed in the
United States and all studies had a mean age between 46.8 and 57.7 years), imprecision (all the
2
studies had small sample sizes), and inconsistency (I test revealed high heterogeneity [>75%]
across studies for all outcomes).
Wang, et al. (2022) included 14 NRSI with wide variation in sample sizes (40-2188) that
comparatively assessed ACDF and ACCF.
40
There was no between-group difference in patient-
reported function; however, improvement in neurological status at 1-60+ months follow-up
favored ACDF (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.91; p = 0.02). Limitations involved the selection of
low-quality studies (all studies were retrospective observational cohorts or case-control
designs) and indirectness (11 of the studies were conducted in Asia [China, South Korea]).
Primary Studies
One RCT that was not included in any evidence synthesis was identiﬁed. El-Ghandour, et al.
(2020) compared ACDF with posterior laminectomy with or without fusion in the management
of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM).
42
Sixty-eight patients (mean age 53 years) were
enrolled in a 1:1 randomized trial. Clinical outcomes were assessed after 1 year. There were
signiﬁcantly better outcomes in patient-reported disability (function) and pain scores in the
ACDF group compared to posterior surgical approaches. The Nurick myelopathy grading scale
showed a nonsigniﬁcant improvement with using the posterior approach. The authors noted
several methodologic limitations including a high risk of bias in the randomization process, small
sample size, and short-term follow-up.
In aggregate, clinical outcomes were found to be largely equivalent regardless of surgical
technique. The overall certainty of the evidence was judged to be very low due to limitations
inherent in the included study designs, indirectness (uncertainty about the applicability to the
US Medicare population), imprecision (variability within studies in the direction and clinical
relevance of effects), and inconsistencies across studies in the magnitude of effect.

All syntheses included NRSI, while RCTs were represented in two reviews.

Fei, et al. (2015) reported on data from 1,246 patients included in 18 primary studies (1 RCT, 17
NRSI).
38
Compared to ACCF, patients who underwent ACDF had superior perioperative
outcomes (length of stay [LOS], operative time, and blood loss). Limitations included the
preponderance of low-quality studies (17 of 18 studies were of observational designs),
indirectness (17 of 18 studies included participants located in China or South Korea, and all the

studies had a mean/median between 32-59 years), imprecision (all studies had small sample
sizes with conﬁdence intervals that crossed the indicator for no effect), and inconsistency
(signiﬁcant heterogeneity for all secondary outcomes).
Han, et al. (2014) included 15 NRSI (1,372 participants) in comparing ACDF and ACCF.
37
No
signiﬁcant difference in operative time was found (MD = -9.34, 95% CI = -42.99 to 24.31; p =
0.59). LOS (MD = -5.60, 95% CI = -7.09 to - 4.11; p<0.00001) and blood loss (MD = -151.35,
95% CI = -253.22 to -49.48; p = 0.004) were both less (better) in the ACDF group vs. the ACCF
group. Limitations involved the low-quality of all included studies (observational cohort or case-
control designs), indirectness (mean ages ranged from 44-58.74 years), imprecision (all studies
had small sample sizes), and inconsistency (high statistical heterogeneity was present for blood
loss and operative time).
A network meta-analysis that included 1,639 patients with multilevel CSM found that ACDF
resulted in a shorter operative time compared (directly and indirectly) to other surgical
techniques (ACCF, CDA, and hybrid surgery).
38
Limitations included low-quality studies (12 of
16 studies were case-control designs), indirectness (indirect comparisons were a core
component of the methodology, 14 studies took place in Asia [China, South Korea, Singapore],
and only a single study included a U.S. population), and imprecision (all studies had small sample sizes).
Montano, et al. (2019) compared the results of ACDF and laminoplasty in 5 NRSI (487
patients).
39
There was a statistically signiﬁcant difference favoring ACDF regarding blood loss
(MD = -131.381; 95% CI, -259.522 to -3.240; p = 0.044). No between-group difference was
seen in operative time (MD = -10.231; 95% CI, -58.612 to 38.149; p = 0.679). Limitations related
to the low-quality of included studies (all were observational cohort or case-control designs), indirectness (all studies had mean ages between 54 and 56.8 years), imprecision (too few
events for all outcomes and wide conﬁdence intervals for all pooled outcomes measured), and
inconsistency (high heterogeneity involving operative time and blood loss).
A total of 5,249 patients from 14 NRSI provided data on surgical outcomes for a systematic
review with meta-analysis.
40
Compared to ACCF, blood loss was signiﬁcantly less in patients
that underwent ACDF (OR = -528.63, 95% CI: -586.86, -470.39; p < 0.00001). Operative time was comparable between the two surgical groups. Limitations were due to the low-quality of
the included studies (all studies were retrospective observational cohorts or case-control
designs) and indirectness (11 of the studies were conducted in Asia [China, South Korea]).
Xu, et al. (2017) pooled data from 6 NRSI (379 patients) in comparing ACDF with posterior
laminoplasty (LAMP).
43
No signiﬁcant differences between the two surgical groups were found
for operative time (MD = 32.81, 95% CI = -26.76 to 92.38; p = 0.28) and blood loss MD = -24.16, 95% CI = -174.47 to 126.15; p = 0.75). Limitations included the low-quality study designs (All

A systematic review with meta-analysis of 669 participants (4 NRSI) assessed surgical
outcomes between ACDF and hybrid surgery.

Blood loss signiﬁcantly favored ACDF over
hybrid surgery (SMD = -30.29, 95% CI = -45.06, -15.52; p <.00001), while operative time was
similar. The limitations of this review involved the low-quality study designs (all studies were
retrospective observational cohorts or case-control designs), and indirectness (none of the
studies were performed in the United States, and the mean age among studies ranged from 46.1 to 54.36 years).
Primary Studies
One RCT that was not included in any evidence synthesis was identiﬁed. El-Ghandour, et al.
(2020) compared ACDF with posterior laminectomy with or without fusion in the management
of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM).
42
Sixty-eight patients (mean age 53 years) were
enrolled in the 1:1 randomized trial. The mean operative dura tion was signiﬁcantly longer in the
ACDF group (p < 0.001). The mean hospital stay was signiﬁcantly longer in the posterior group
(p < 0.001). The authors noted several methodologic limitations including a high risk of bias in
the randomization process, small sample size, and short-term follow-up.
Overall, the observed perioperative results varied by the comparators and the type of outcome.
Compared to open PCF, ACDF had signiﬁcantly longer operative time and LOS. MI-PCF also had
a signiﬁcantly less LOS than ACDF. When ACDF was compared to other surgical techniques, no
signiﬁcant differences were found in operative time and blood loss. The overall certainty of the
evidence was rated as very low due to the high risk of bias in the included RCTs, limitations
inherent in observational studies, and uncertainty about the applicability of the results to the
U.S. Medicare population (indirectness).
Radiographic Outcomes
Five evidence syntheses included assessments of radiographic outcomes (fusion rate, range of
motion [ROM], alignment, and lordotic.
36,37,39,40
Fusion rate was recorded in a systematic review with meta-analysis of 18 primary studies (1
RCT, 17 NRSI).
36
After a minimum of 6 months post-surgery, the authors found the fusion rate
was 100% for patients that underwent ACDF and ACCF. Review limitations involved the low-
quality of selected studies (17 of 18 studies were of observational designs), indirectness (17 of
18 studies included participants located in China or South Korea, and all the studies had a
mean/median between 32-59 years), imprecision (all studies had small sample sizes with
conﬁdence intervals that crossed the indicator for no effect), and inconsistency (there was
signiﬁcant heterogeneity for all secondary outcomes except fusion rate).
In another systematic review with meta-analysis, Han, et al. (2014) also reported no difference
in fusion rates between ACDF and ACCF (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.34 to 4.11; p = 0.80).

and segmental angles were measured at a minimum of 24 months follow-up. ACDF showed
statistically signiﬁcant outcomes compared to ACCF. The limitations in this review included the
low-quality of the selected studies (all studies were observational cohort or case-control
designs), indirectness (mean ages ranged from 44-58.74 years), imprecision (all studies had
small sample sizes), and inconsistency (high statistical heterogeneity was present for fusion
rate and Cobb angle).
Montano, et al. (2019) conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis that compared
radiographic outcomes reported in 5 NRSI between ACDF and laminoplasty.
39
The Cobb angle
(cervical lordosis) results were signiﬁcantly better for the ACDF group (MD = 5.63; 95% CI,
1.663-8.469; p = 0.004), while ROM favored laminoplasty (MD = -5.399; 95% CI, -10.584 to
0.214; p = 0.041). Limitations included the low-quality of analyzed studies (all were
observational cohort or case-control designs), indirectness (all studies had mean ages between
54 and 56.8 years) imprecision (too few events for all outcomes and wide conﬁdence intervals
for all pooled outcomes measured), and inconsistency (high heterogeneity involving cervical
lordosis and ROM.
A systematic review with meta-analysis of 14 NRSI (5,249 patients diagnosed with multilevel
CSM) reported statistically signiﬁcant results favoring ACDF versus ACCF in sagittal and
segmental angles, as well as fusion rate.
40
Limitations were due to the low-quality of the
included studies (all studies were retrospective observational cohorts or case-control designs)
and indirectness (11 of the studies were conducted in Asia [China, South Korea]).
Zhao, et al. (2018) evaluated the radiographic effects of ACDF compared to hybrid surgery.
44
The meta-analysis of 669 patients (4 NRSI) found no signiﬁcant differences in fusion rate and
C2-C7 (Cobb) angle at 24 to 38 months post-surgery. Review limitations included the low-
quality of the selected studies (all were retrospective observational cohorts or case-control
designs), indirectness (none of the studies were performed in the United States and the mean
age among studies ranged from 46.1 to 54.36 years), imprecision (wide conﬁdence angles that
represented variable outcomes were found in the pooled data fusion rate), and inconsistency
(heterogeneity of effects in the pooled analyses for C2-C7 angle and fusion rate).
In aggregate, radiographic outcomes – obtained at variable time points – showed equitable or
favorable results in fusion rate, angular measurements, and alignment for ACDF compared to
ACCF, laminoplasty, and hybrid surgery. Laminoplasty was superior to ACDF in preserving
ROM. The certainty of the evidence was determined to be very low due to the types of included
study designs (mostly retrospective NRSI), uncertainty about the generalizability to the U.S. Medicare population, imprecise results, and heterogeneity of ﬁndings.
Undesirable Effects
Six evidence syntheses provided ﬁndings regarding a range of undesirable effects associated
with cervical fusion surgeries.
36-40,44
Four reviews focused on the total or overall complication

rate.
36-39
In addition to the total complication rate, two syntheses detailed the results of a range
of undesirable effects.
40,44
Fei, et al. (2015) reported that the total complication rate was signiﬁcantly lower for individuals
with ACDF than ACCF (RR= 0.51, 95% CI: 0.33, 0.80; p = 0.003).
36
This result was based on a
meta-analysis of 1,246 patients, with a minimum of 6 months follow-up. Limitation of this
evidence synthesis were the low-quality of the selected studies (17 of 18 studies were of
observational designs), indirectness (17 of 18 studies included participants located in China or
South Korea, and all the studies had a mean/median between 32-59 years), imprecision (all
studies had small sample sizes with conﬁdence intervals that crossed the indicator for no
effect), and signiﬁcant heterogeneity was present.
Another systematic review with meta-analysis of 1,372 patients diagnosed with multilevel CSM
also determined the incidence of overall complications was signiﬁcantly greater in the ACCF
group compared to those who had ACDF surgery (OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.35 to 0.73; p =
0.0003).
37
In this review the minimum follow-up period was 24 months. Limitations involved the
low-quality of all included studies (observational cohort or case-control designs), indirectness
(mean ages ranged from 44-58.74 years), and imprecision (all studies had small sample sizes)
A network meta-analysis calculated both direct and indirect comparisons of overall
complications for patients who had undergone ACDF, ACCF, CDA, or hybrid surgery.
38
At a
post-operative mean of 33.3 months, CDA resulted in a lower incidence of complications than
different types of cervical fusion procedures. The limitations of this network meta-analysis
included the low-quality of most study designs (12 of 16 studies were case-control designs),
indirectness (indirect comparisons were a core component of the methodology, and only a
single study included a U.S. population), and imprecision (all studies had small sample sizes).
A systematic review with meta-analysis included 5 NRSI (N=487) that compared outcomes
(mean 35.4 months) between ACDF and laminoplasty.
39
There was no statistically signiﬁcant
difference regarding the complication rate (OR = 1.604; 95% CI, 0.972-2.648; p = 0.065).
Limitations included the low-quality of the selected studies (all included studies were
observational cohort or case-control designs), indirectness (all studies had mean ages between
54 and 56.8 years), and imprecision (wide conﬁdence intervals for all pooled data).
Wang, et al. (2022) included data from 5,249 participants (14 NRSI) in a systematic review with
meta-analysis.
40
The number of total complications was signiﬁcantly less for individuals that
received ACDF compared to ACCF (OR=0.56, 95% CI: 0.48-0.65; p < 0.00001). This study
provided additional details about speciﬁc undesired effects. No signiﬁcant difference between
ACDF and ACCF was found for dysphagia, hoarseness, cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) leakage,
infection rate, epidural hematoma, axial pain, hardware breakage, and pseudoarthrosis. ACDF
demonstrated statistically superior outcomes regarding the event rate of C5 palsy, revision surgeries, graft subsidence, and graft dislodgement. The limitations of this review were related
to the low-quality of all the selected studies (retrospective observational cohorts or case-control
designs), and indirectness (11 of the studies were conducted in China or South Korea).

LCD - Cervical Fusion (L39758)
Zhao, et al. (2018) compared ACDF to hybrid surgery, pooling data from 4 NRSI that comprised
669 patients.
44
Post-surgical outcomes were captured between 24 and 38 months. There was a
signiﬁcant difference in total complications favoring ACDF (OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.44-0.98; P =
.04). At the discrete outcome level, there was no signiﬁcant difference between ACDF and hybrid surgery seen for graft subsidence, C5 palsy, infection, CSF leakage, dysphagia, or
epidural hematoma. Limitations related to the low-quality of all the selected studies
(retrospective observational cohorts or case-control designs), and indirectness (none of the
studies were performed in the United States, and mean age among studies ranged from 46.1
and 54.36 years), and imprecision (wide conﬁdence intervals, representative of variable
outcomes, were found in the pooled data subgroup analyses for graft subsidence, infection rate,
and CSF leakage).
Primary Studies
One RCT that was not included in any evidence synthesis was identiﬁed. El-Ghandour, et al
(2020) compared ACDF with posterior laminectomy with or without fusion in the management
of degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM).
42
Sixty-eight patients (mean age 53 years) were
enrolled in the 1:1 randomized trial. No signiﬁcant difference in postoperative complications was found, except postoperative dysphagia was signiﬁcantly higher in the anterior group (p < 0.05).
The authors noted several methodologic limitations including a high risk of bias in the
randomization process, small sample size, and short-term follow-up.
A retrospective cohort compared the short-term outcomes for laminoplasty, laminectomy with
45
fusion, and ACDF. Data from 546 patients resulted in the authors concluding that
laminectomy with fusion carries the highest risk for morbidity, mortality, and unplanned
readmissions in the short-term postoperative period. Laminoplasty and ACDF cases carry
similar short-term complications and risks. Study limitations include the retrospective design,
short-term (30-day) outcomes, and clinical heterogeneity.
Overall, apart from CDA, the complication rate favored ACDF over other types of fusion and
non-fusion surgeries. The certainty of the evidence was judged to be very low due to inherent
study design limitations, indirectness, imprecision involving subgroup analyses, and signiﬁcant heterogeneity.
Cervical Myeloradiculopathy (Mixed)
Cervical myelopathy occurs when there is compression of the spinal cord in the neck area.
Patients present with issues with ﬁne motor skills, pain or stiffness in the neck and loss of
balance. Causes of cervical myelopathy may include Rheumatoid arthritis, cervical spine
trauma, spinal infection, spinal tumors or cancer.
46
Myelopathy and cervical spine instability severity is classiﬁed based on the criteria put forth by
Ranawat.

Clinical Outcomes
Four evidence syntheses with publication dates ranging from 2013-2022 that assessed clinical
outcomes were identiﬁed.
49-52
All the syntheses included only randomized controlled trials. The
number of primary studies in the syntheses ranged from 8 to 30, with generally small sample
sizes. The eligibility criteria included participants that were diagnosed with single or multilevel
cervical radiculopathy, myelopathy, or both (myeloradiculopathy). All reviews compared the
effects of ACDF to CDA. Timing to follow-up was variable (29 months to ~8 years).
Núñez, et al. (2022) published a systematic review with meta-analysis that comprised 9 RCTs
with sample sizes ranging from 44 to 541.
49
Clinical outcomes were assessed at a mean of 7.8
years post-surgery. The overall success rate in the CDA group was signiﬁcantly higher than in
the ACDF group (OR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.57–2.49, p < 0.001) with moderate heterogeneity (I =
2
36%, p = 0.16). There were no signiﬁcant differences between the 2 groups regarding neck pain (SMD = − 0.17, 95% CI: − 0.37–0.04, p = 0.11) with high heterogeneity (I = 74%, p = 0.002). Patient-reported arm pain results signiﬁcantly favored the CDA group (SMD = − 0.16, 95% CI: − 0.29 to − 0.04, p = 0.01) with moderate heterogeneity (I = 31%, p = 0.20). The physical SF-36 (quality of life) component signiﬁcantly favored the CDA group (SMD = 0.13 95% CI: 0.03–0.23, p = 0.01) with very low heterogeneity (I = 1%, p = 0.40). No signiﬁcant differences were found between the 2 groups in the mental SF-36 component (SMD = 0.19, 95% CI: − 0.03–0.41, p = 0.10), with substantial heterogeneity (I = 69%, p = 0.02). Limitations of this review included a
2

2
2
high or unclear risk of bias involving all RCTs, indirectness (the mean age across studies was
~44.5 years), some imprecision involving overall treatment success, signiﬁcant heterogeneity
was present in all pooled clinical results.
Peng, et al. (2022) produced a systematic review with meta-analysis of 9,329 participants with
single or multilevel cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy. At multiple follow-up time points,
overall success favored CDA (total, OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.73 to 2.11, p=0.000).
50
Neurological
success results also favored CDA in all follow-up periods (total, OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.49 to 2.04, p
= 0.000). Disability results in all follow-up periods favored CDA (total, OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.49 to
1.94, p = 0.000). Limitations of this analysis included all primary studies were rated as having
unclear (some concerns) or high risk of bias, indirectness (the mean age among the studies
ranged between 40-50 years), and imprecision (all pooled analyses for each follow-up period
had conﬁdence intervals that crossed the null value).
Xing, et al. (2013) included 8 RCTs with sample sizes ranging from 19 to 541. Participants
(N=1,617) had single-level cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy [Xing]. Outcomes were
measured between 24 and 48 months. For overall success, CDA was signiﬁcantly superior to
2
ACDF (OR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.43 to 2.36; p < 0.00001), with no heterogeneity (I = 0%). The
neurological success rate results showed CDA was signiﬁcantly superior to ACDF (OR = 1.75,

95% CI = 1.20 to 2.55; p = 0.004), with no heterogeneity (I = 0%). There was no signiﬁcant
difference between the two treatment groups concerning disability measures. For arm pain,
there was a signiﬁcant difference between the two groups favoring CDA (MD = -4.86, 95% CI =
6.42 to -3.30; p < 0.00001) with low heterogeneity (I = 8%). There was a signiﬁcant difference 2
between the two groups favoring CDA (MD = -7.90, 95% CI = -10.36 to -5.44; p < 0.00001) with
2
no heterogeneity (I = 0%) regarding neck pain outcomes. Limitations of this evidence synthesis
included all primary studies were rated as having unclear (some concerns) or high risk of bias,
indirectness (the mean age of included studies was 43 years), imprecision (six of eight [75%] of
studies had sample sizes smaller than 400 and all pooled analyses exhibited conﬁdence
intervals that crossed the null value), and inconsistency (moderate heterogeneity in the pooled
results for disability).
Zhang, et al. (2020) included 1,238 participants from 13 RCTs in a systematic review with meta-
analysis.
52
Outcomes were assessed at a mean of 83 months. The overall success rate
signiﬁcantly favored the CDA group compared to the ACDF group (OR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.29–
2
2.19, p < 0.001) with low heterogeneity (I = 0%, p = 0.62). The CDA group had signiﬁcantly
higher neurological success than the ACDF group (OR = 1.54, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI]:
2
1.14– 2.08, p = 0.004) with moderate heterogeneity (I = 34.0%, p = 0.18). For disability results, the CDA group was signiﬁcantly improved versus the ACDF group (MD = − 0.20, 95% CI: − 0.36 to − 0.05, p = 0.009), with moderate heterogeneity (I = 37.8%, p = 0.20); however, the effect size did not reach clinical relevance. Measures of quality-of-life were better in the CDA group;
2
however, neither statistical nor clinical signiﬁcance was achieved. Both neck and arm pain were sig niﬁcantly better in the CDA group than in the ACDF group (MD = − 0.20, 95% CI: − 0.35 to − 0.05, p = 0.01 and MD = − 0.23, 95% CI: − 0.38 to − 0.07, p = 0.004, re spectively), with low heterogeneity (I = 31.6%, p = 0.23 and I = 24.3%, p = 0.27, respectively). Limitations of this evidence synthesis included studies were rated as having unclear (some concerns) or high risk

2
of bias, indirectness (the mean age across studies was ~44.5 years), imprecision (conﬁdence
intervals crossed the null effect), and inconsistency (moderate to substantial heterogeneity was
found in the pooled analyses for neurological success and disability outcomes).
In aggregate, CDA demonstrated statistically signiﬁcant improvement across clinical outcomes
apart from quality-of-life measures, which were similar to ACDF. The clinical signiﬁcance of the
results was not described when assessing most pooled results for speciﬁc outcomes. Overall,
the certainty of evidence was judged to be very low. All the included RCTs were rated as having
unclear (some concerns) or a high risk of bias. The mean age among the studies ranged
between 40-50 years and clinical relevance was not usually assessed (indirectness). More than
50% of studies had small sample sizes and wide conﬁdence intervals suggesting variable
effects (imprecision).
Surgical Outcomes

LCD - Cervical Fusion (L39758)
Peng, et al. (2022) conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis of 30 RCTs.
50
Participants (N=9,329) with single or multilevel cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy randomly
underwent ACDF or CDA. The pooled data showed ACDF had a signiﬁcantly longer operative duration (OR, − 0.28; 95% CI, − 0.37 to − 0.2; p = 0.000). There were no signiﬁcant differences between CDA and ACDF for blood loss and LOS (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, − 2.83 to 4.1; p = 0.72; OR, − 0.01; 95% CI, − 0.08 to 0.05; p = 0.68, respectively). The limitations of this analysis included all primary studies were rated as having unclear (some concerns) or high risk of bias, indirectness
(the mean age among the studies ranged between 40-50 years), and imprecision (all pooled
analyses for each follow-up period had conﬁdence intervals that crossed the null value).
Based on limited data, CDA demonstrated more than a 25% reduction in operative time
compared to ACDF. There were no other perioperative outcomes that revealed signiﬁcant
differences between CDA and ACDF. The certainty of the evidence was rated as very low. All
included primary studies had unclear (some concerns) or a high risk of bias. There was
uncertainty about the applicability of the results to the U.S. Medicare population (indirectness).
All pooled analyses for each follow-up period had conﬁdence intervals that crossed the null
value (imprecision).
Radiographic Outcomes
Three evidence syntheses reported on radiographic results in comparing ACDF with CDA.
Núñez, et al. (2022) systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed data from 9 RCTs (N=2,664)
who received either ACDF or CDA.
49
The fusion rate was 94.06% in the ACDF group, with no
data for CDA. The heterotopic ossiﬁcation rate for CDA = 10.3%, with no data for ACDF. The
ROM rate in the CDA group was signiﬁcantly higher (SMD = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.63–2.08, p < 0.001)
2
with no heterogeneity (I = 0%, p = 0.52). Less superior adjacent segment disease (ASD) was
reported in the CDA group (OR = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.17–0.65, p = 0.001) with substantial
2
heterogeneity (I = 81%, p < 0.001). Less inferior ASD was reported in the CDA group (OR =
2
0.31, 95% CI: 0.15–0.66, p = 0.002), with substantial heterogeneity (I = 75.1%, p = 0.05).
Limitations of this review included a high or unclear risk of bias involving all RCTs, indirectness
(the mean age across studies was ~44.5 years), and inconsistency (signiﬁcant heterogeneity
was present in all pooled results except ROM).
Xing, et al. (2013) measured radiological success as part of a systematic review with meta-
analysis.
51
There was no signiﬁcant difference between the ACDF and CDA groups (OR = 0.87,
95% CI = 0.36 to 2.09; p = 0.76). Limitations of this evidence synthesis included all primary
studies were rated as having unclear (some concerns) or high risk of bias, indirectness (the
mean age of included studies was 43 years), and imprecision (six of eight {75%} of studies had
sample sizes smaller than 400 and all pooled analyses exhibited conﬁdence intervals that
crossed the null value).
Zhang, et al. (2020) pooled data from 13 RCTs (N=1,238) in assessing ROM between patients
who had ACDF or CDA.

(MD = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.57– 1.94, p < 0.001) with low heterogeneity (I = 0%, p = 0.38).
Limitations of this evidence synthesis included all studies having unclear (some concerns) or
high risk of bias, indirectness (the mean age across studies was ~44.5 years), imprecision
(conﬁdence intervals crossed the null effect), and inconsistency (moderate heterogeneity
regarding ASD outcomes).
Overall, apart from overall success, CDA demonstrated statistically greater radiological results
when compared to ACDF. The certainty of the evidence was determined to be very low.
Limitations included high or uncertain risk of bias across all included trials, indirectness,
imprecision, and heterogeneity (ASD outcomes).
Undesirable Effects
Four evidence syntheses reported the pooled results of undesirable effects associated with
cervical spine surgeries. All studies were conducted as systematic reviews with meta-analysis
of RCTs.
49-52
Núñez, et al. (2022) described outcomes for 2,664 participants obtained from 9 RCTs.
49
For
overall complication rate, no signiﬁcant differences were found between CDA (33.1%) and
ACDF (38.9%) (OR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.56–1.27, p = 0.42), with moderate heterogeneity (I = 37%,
2
p = 0.13). (p = 0.42). Reoperations occurred in 4.4% of CDA patients, a signiﬁcantly lower rate compared with 15.6% of the ACDF group (OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.19–0.37, p< 0.001), with no
2
heterogeneity (I = 0.0%, p = 0.97). The limitations of this review included a high or unclear risk
of bias involving all RCTs, indirectness (the mean age across studies was ~44.5 years), and
inconsistency (signiﬁcant heterogeneity was present in the pooled results).
Peng, et al. (2022) included 30 RCTs (N=9,329) in the review comparing ACDF with CDA.
50
In
assessing implant events, no signiﬁcant difference was found between the CDA and ACDF
groups in short-term, mid-term, and long-term follow-up and total analysis (total, OR 1.14, 95%
CI 0.92 to 1.42, p = 0.23). The incidence of ASD was higher in the ACDF group in long-term
follow-up and total analysis (total, OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.94, p = 0.01). The incidence of
dysphagia and dysphonia was higher in ACDF in short-term follow-up. There were no
signiﬁcant differences in total, mid- and long-term follow-up between CDA and ACDF (total, OR
0.9, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.09, p = 0.28). The reoperation rate was higher in ACDF in all follow-ups
(total, OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.46, p = 0.000). This analysis had limitations including all
primary studies were rated as having unclear (some concerns) or high risk of bias, indirectness

(the mean age of included studies was 43 years), and imprecision (six of eight {75%} of studies
had sample sizes smaller than 400 and all pooled analyses exhibited conﬁdence intervals that
crossed the null value).
Zhang, et al. (2020) provided a comprehensive meta-analysis of undesired effects for 1,238
participants who underwent ACDF or CDA.
52
The difference in complication rates was not
signiﬁcant between the two groups (OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.77–1.32, p = 0.96), with low
2
heterogeneity (I = 8.4%, p = 0.37). For reoperations at the index level, the rate was signiﬁcantly
lower in the CDA group than in the ACDF group (OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.25–0.69, p = 0.001), with
2
substantial heterogeneity (I = 61.0%, p = 0.004). For reoperation at an adjacent level, the rate
was signiﬁcantly lower in the CDA group than in the ACDF group (OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.26–
2
0.46, p < 0.001), with low heterogeneity (I = 23.4%, p = 0.22). Limitations of this evidence
synthesis included all studies having unclear (some concerns) or high risk of bias, indirectness
(the mean age across studies was ~44.5 years), imprecision (conﬁdence intervals crossed the
null effect), and inconsistency (substantial heterogeneity regarding the reoperation rate).
In aggregate, ACDF and CDA demonstrate similar overall complication rates; however, CDA
resulted in fewer reoperations and less ASD. ACDF and CDA result in equitable long-term
dysphagia and dysphonia outcomes. The overall certainty of the evidence was determined to be
very low due to the high or unclear risk of bias in the included RCTs, indirectness, imprecise
results, and inconsistency (heterogeneity) affecting multiple outcomes.
Societal Guidance

North American Spine Society (NASS) appropriateness criteria for cervical fusion surgery as a treatment for cervical myelopathy states “While there are some non-fusion procedures
available to decompress the spinal canal such as laminoplasty and anterior cervical discectomy
without fusion, the workhorses of surgical treatments for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM)
are ACDF, anterior corpectomy and fusion, and posterior laminectomy and fusion. It is well-
accepted that non-operative care is acceptable in patients with mild myelopathy and that
surgery should be considered in most. Anterior cervical decompression and fusion has become
the most common surgical approach and technique for treating patients with CSM. With the
availability of modern posterior cervical screw ﬁxation, posterior cervical laminectomy and
fusion has become an additional workhorse for treatment of CSM, with equivalent results as
anterior surgery.”
Cervical myelopathy: (either from disc herniation, bony stenosis, or ossiﬁcation of posterior
longitudinal ligament [OPLL]) may be considered as an adjunct to decompression when anterior
cervical discectomy, corpectomy or posterior laminectomy is planned for decompression of the
spinal cord.
A multidisciplinary expert panel deﬁned appropriate use criteria (AUC) of cervical fusion for the treatment of degenerative conditions of the cervical spine [Reitman]. Appropriate use criteria
were developed using the RAND/UCLA appropriateness methodology. All scenarios included a

surgical plan as either cervical fusion (nonspeciﬁc) or speciﬁed as anterior cervical fusion (ACF),
posterior cervical fusion (PCF), or combined (APCF). Clinical scenarios involving myelopathy
was most strongly associated with an “Appropriate” rating. A total of 92% of scenarios with
myelopathy, and well controlled medical or mild psychosocial comorbidities, or smokers,
received a ﬁnal rating of “Appropriate.” All (100%) scenarios with myelopathy and poorly
controlled medical or mild psychosocial comorbidities, or smokers, received a ﬁnal rating of
“Appropriate” for cervical fusion surgery.

AOSpine North America and the Cervical Spine Research Society published clinical practice guidelines that outline recommendations about how to best manage (1) patients with mild,
moderate, and severe myelopathy and (2) nonmyelopathic patients with evidence of cord
compression with or without clinical symptoms of radiculopathy.
Recommendations based on 5 systematic reviews of the literature concerning the value of
surgery and nonsurgical approaches for CSM were as follows: (1) “We recommend surgical
intervention for patients with moderate and severe DCM.” (2) “We suggest offering surgical
intervention or a supervised trial of structured rehabilitation for patients with mild DCM. If initial
nonoperative management is pursued, we recommend operative intervention if there is
neurological dete rioration and suggest operative intervention if the patient fails to improve.” (3)
“We suggest not offering prophylactic surgery for nonmyelopathic patients with evidence of
cervical cord compression without signs or symptoms of radiculopathy. We suggest that these
patients be counseled as to potential risks of progression, educated about relevant signs and
symptoms of myelopathy, and be followed clinically.” (4) “Non-myelopathic patients with cord
compression and clinical evidence of radiculopathy with or without electrophysiological
conﬁrmation are at a higher risk of developing myelopathy and should be counseled about this
risk. We suggest offering either surgical intervention or nonoperative treatment consisting of
close serial follow-up or a supervised trial of structured rehabilitation. In the event of
myelopathic development, the patient should be managed according to the recommendations
above.”
The World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) The Spine Committee of the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) formulated an evidence-based consensus meeting on the management of CSM to develop recommendations for global applicability.
54
With some adaptations, the WFNS Spine Committee endorsed the guidelines of AOSpine North
America and the Cervical Spine Research Society.
53
Additional recommendations include: using
mJOA or its regional modiﬁcations to classify CSM as severe, moderate or mild and suggest
offering surgical intervention or rehabilitation for patients with mild CSM (modiﬁed Japanese
Orthopedic Association scale [mJOA] score 15–17. They state there is a consistent lack of
evidence regarding the value of nonoperative treatment of cervical myelopathy in the literature
hence nonoperative treatment may not be the ﬁnal decision in most cases. They also share that
predicting factors that indicate a possible deterioration during nonoperative, important
predictors of myelopathy development include the presence of symptomatic radiculopathy,
prolonged motor evoked potentials and somatosensory evoked po tentials and

electromyography signs of anterior horn cell lesions (low evidence), patients are likely to achieve
a better result after surgery if they have a shorter duration of symptoms (low evidence) and a
call for additional RCTs.
World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) Spine Committee recommendations include:
In patients with CSM, the indications for surgery include persistent or recurrent
radiculopathy nonresponsive to conservative treatment (3 years); progressive neurological
deﬁcit; static neurological deﬁcit with severe radicular pain when associated with
conﬁrmatory imaging (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) and clinical-
radiological correlation.
The indications of anterior surgery for patients with CSM include straightened spine or
kyphotic spine with a compression level below.
They clarify in the elderly age groups with bony ankylosis due to osteophytes at C5–6–7, CSM
may manifest at higher levels where motion segments are preserved, especially the C3–4 level
and also at lower levels such as the C7–T1 level. These guidelines provide directives for future
research with suggested outcome measures, variabilities to consider as well as patient and
surgery selection guidance.

analyzed and pro posed their own recommendations
for the management of CSM in accordance with the recommendations published by the spine
committee of the WFNS. The majority of WFNS recommendations were adopted with a few
modiﬁcations.

evidence analysis are reported here:
For mild cases of CSM, conservative treatment is primarily selected; however, at present
there is insufﬁcient evidence regarding treatment outcomes. Surgery is considered suitable
for progressive myelopathy in which conservative treatment is unsuccessful.
It is possible that conservative treatment can delay the progression of mild-to-moderate
CSM, and therefore, performing conservative treatment is weakly recommended. For severe
and progressive CSM, surgery is likely the ﬁrst choice of treatment. However, there are few
reports regarding the choice of treatment for mild and moderate CSM, and thus, it is difﬁcult
to draw a conclusion.
There is no clear recommendation regarding which surgeries to perform

resulting in radiculopathy or myelopathy. PubMed and Embase were searched for applicable
literature resulting in a total of 33 and 31 articles which included in the systematic review and
the meta-analysis, respectively. Changes in values of preoperative to postoperative patient-
reported outcomes (visual analog scales for arm pain and neck pain, Neck Disability Index (NDI),
JOA score, modiﬁed JOA score, and Nurick pain scale) were evaluated. Patient reported
outcomes, successful fusion, revision surgeries, and complications/adverse events were
considered. A subgroup analysis was performed in two instances; one for studies that included
surgical indications for only myelopathy or radiculopathy (or combination) and another for
studies that included surgical indications for only myelopathy or ossiﬁcations of the posterior
longitudinal ligament (or combination). Cumulative changes in PROMs improved for all surgical
indications including the two subgroup analyses. All surgical indications resulted in pooled
outcomes rates of 98.25% for successful fusion, 1.09% for revision, and 9.02% for
complications/adverse events. Axial pain, C5 palsy, transient neurological worsening, and
wound infection were the most common complications. Limitations include high risk of bias,
reporting bias, confounding, high heterogeneity, included 20/31 retrospective studies, and
combining of different PROMs. Authors report many conﬂicts of interest but none that seem to
impact this study; however, the study was funded by Providence Medical Technology, Inc.
Unstable Spine
Systematic Review/Meta-Analysis Mahmoud and colleagues conducted a systematic review 58 comprised of 627 patients and 36 articles to review the surgical indications, complications, and
functional outcomes of different approaches for hangman fractures. Selected literature
contained at least one of the primary outcomes: functional outcomes, complication rates,
operation time, and blood loss. Minimally invasive surgery, C2 direct pedicle screw, C2- C3
fusion, and ACDF techniques were reviewed. VAS scores fell in all four groups when comparing
pre- and postoperative scores, with the lowest VAS scores observed in the minimally invasive
surgery group. In unstable fracture patterns, the literature showed that ACDF was preferred.
Complications remained low in all groups with the greatest blood loss occurring in the posterior
approach (255.9 mL in open posterior approach, 75.8 mL in MIS, and 64.3 mL in ACDF). Authors
concluded if indicated, posterior approach may be preferred due to lower blood loss and disc
access. When considering posterior approach, MIS may improve outcomes and have fewer
complications. Limitations of the present study are inclusion of studies with retrospective study
design, variations in reporting methods making data points challenging to categorize and lack
comparative outcome studies.

advantages were associated with combined fusion in terms of biomechanical stability. Selective
use of methods should be determined based on type of injury. Authors also note need for control
of technical factors of surgery that may have impacted results of cervical fusion. Limitations
include a small sample size, in vitro studies, low number of studies included for analysis, and
risk of bias.
Prospective
60
Yang et al. performed a prospective study to propose a novel classiﬁcation and scoring
system called the posterior ligament-bone injury classiﬁcation and severity score (PLICS) that
offers a quantitative score to guide the need for posterior stabilization in addition to anterior
reconstruction for subaxial cervical fracture dislocations (SCFDs). The study included 456 SCFD patients. High risk patients were deﬁned as having PLICS ≥ 7 together with extremely unstable lateral mass fracture (EULMF). All others were deﬁned as low-risk patients. Anterior only
reconstruction was performed in the low-risk patients and additional posterior lateral mass
ﬁxation and fusion was performed after anterior reconstruction in the high-risk patients. The
visual analogue score (VAS), the NDI, the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment
scale were utilized for outcomes. At 12 month follow up, 321 patients in the low-risk group and
49 patients in the high-risk group were still participating. VAS scores from preoperative to 12
months signiﬁcantly improved (from 6.1 + 0.3 to 1.1 + 0.2 in the low-risk group, P < 0.001; from
6.4 + 0.2 to 1.4 + 0.2 in the high-risk group, P < 0.001). In the low-risk group at 12 month follow
up the average NDI score was statistically low 8.8 + 2.5 vs 13.8 + 3.4, P = 0.034). With regards
to the ASIA scale, 80.5% of patients experienced >1 grade improvement. Authors concluded for
SCFD patients, EULMF and a PLICS score of 7 or greater may serve as a threshold for posterior
stabilization in addition to anterior reconstruction. Limitations include the study design, patient
selection methods, and exclusion of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients.
61
Madan et al. conducted a prospective cohort study to assess the functional, neurological, and
radiological outcomes of the patients with traumatic cervical spine instability. A total of 99
patients with subaxial cervical spine injuries were admitted and operated on at a single center
between February 2014 and February 2016 and included prospectively. In all patients, bony
fusion, neurological recovery, NDI and complications were assessed during the mean follow up
period of 27 months (range 12–42 months). Corpectomy procedures that involved 1 level were
77.8% (n=77), 2 levels were 19.2% (n=19) and 3 levels were 3% (n=3). Neck Disability Index
resulted in a mean of 7.57 ± 5.42. Grade 1 fusion was reported in 64.6% of cases. The most
frequent adverse event was dysphagia 79.8% (n=79). Authors concluded an appropriate
treatment option for subaxial cervical spine injuries is anterior cervical corpectomy and
stabilization with cage ﬁlled with bone and cervical reﬂex locking plate. Authors further state
this procedure is associated with favorable fusion rates and is likely a procedure of choice for
posttraumatic multiple disc prolapse. Limitations of this study include study design, single center inclusion, risk of bias and sample size.

A prospective cohort study sponsored by the International Spine Study Group (ISSG) followed
77 patients surgically treated for adult cervical deformities for 1-year.62 Diagnoses included
cervical sagittal imbalance (56%), cervical kyphosis (55%), proximal junctional kyphosis (7%)
and coronal deformity (9%). Posterior fusion was performed in 85% (mean levels = 10), and
anterior fusion was performed in 53% (mean levels = 5). At 1 year after surgery the cohort
reported statistically signiﬁcant improvement in neck pain, ability to perform usual activities and
reduced pain and discomfort measured by standardized scales. Limitations include lack of
control group, short term follow-up, performance at high volume centers with experienced
surgeons that can reduce generalizability, and lack of standardized selection for surgery.
Retrospective
63
Zheng and associates conducted a single center, retrospective, observational study comprised
of 79 patients to investigate the role of ACDF in alleviating symptoms in patients with cervical
vertigo associated with cervical instability. A signiﬁcant relief of vertigo and dizziness was
reported following anterior cervical surgery during the 2 year follow up period.

Yang and associates performed a retrospective chart review to investigate the efﬁcacy and
safety of halo vest application before and during surgery in 25 patients with AS and severe
thoracic kyphosis who underwent surgical treatment of cervical fracture-dislocation. Posterior
or combined anterior-posterior surgery was performed on all patients. Authors conclude that
use of the halo vest before and during the surgery is safe and effective while assisting with
positioning, awake nasoendotracheal intubation, nursing, and the procedure by providing
satisfactory reduction and immobilization.
65
Wang et al. performed a retrospective chart review comprised of 36 patients to investigate
the safety and efﬁcacy of the halo-vest in the treatment of cervical fracture in patients with
ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and kyphosis. Authors concluded The AS patient should undergo
early surgical stabilization utilizing a halo-vest to aid in spinal deformity correction and to avoid
neurological decline.
66
Skeppholm and associates conducted a cohort study of 28 patients with artiﬁcial disc
replacement (ADR) or anterior cervical decompression which were recruited from a larger RCT
cohort to evaluate in vivo motion and stability of implanted artiﬁcial discs. Authors concluded
most of the ADRs resulted in favorable mobility and proper attachment years after implantation
with instability detected in only 8% of patients.

evaluate surgical outcomes and complications of cervical spine fractures in ankylosing
spondylitis (CAS) patients who were treated using either the posterior (P) or combined
approach after experiencing neck pain after a fall. Authors conclude, although not statistically
signiﬁcant, posterior surgery was associated with lower blood loss, rate of complications, and
shorter length of stay as compared to the combined approach. Limitations include study design,
small sample size, and moderate lost to follow up rate.

anterior discectomy/corpectomy and fusion combined with internal ﬁxation is a favorable
approach.
70
Lee and associates conducted a retrospective review of radiologic images of patients (n=34)
who underwent C1-2 fusion. Patients were divided into one of two groups (the C-arm group or

Lang and colleagues conducted a cohort study comprised of 33 patients to assess the
radiological and mid-term patient-reported outcome of traumatic subaxial cervical fractures
treated with different plate systems. Authors concluded regarding a fragile fracture, that
dynamic plate provided adequate stability with no signiﬁcant loss of reduction when compared
to the rigid plates. Patient-reported outcome were satisfactory in both groups.
72
Kong and associates retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 46 patients who underwent C2-
3 ACDF combined with internal ﬁxation for unstable hangman’s fractures to investigate the
changes in the sagittal parameters of the cervical spine and the clinical efﬁcacy of C2-3 ACDF
combined with internal ﬁxation. Authors conclude that anterior reconstruction of the anterior

displacement and angulation of C2, and restore sagittal balance while maintaining a high rate
of fusion with few complications.

state recovery of cervical sagittal balance was achieved by utilizing the posterior approach as
compared to the anterior approach.
76
Garrido and colleagues conducted a retrospective data review of 71 cases to assess the
clinical outcomes of both rigid and nonrigid occipitocervical (OC) fusion constructs of a

Dagtekin et al. conducted a single center retrospective study comprised of 88 patients were
included to evaluate OCJ injuries and to discuss the treatment modalities of these traumas and
examine cadaveric studies for a better understanding. Authors concluded while it is essential to

Clark et al. conducted a retrospective chart review comprised of 43 consecutive patients to
evaluate 30-day and 1-year mortality rates and review complications associated with posterior
C1–2 fusion in an octogenarian cohort. Authors conclude in the octogenarian population a
greater mortality rate is associated with Initial fracture displacement. Lower mortality rates
resulted with posterior C1-2 fusions with unstable type II odontoid fractures as compared to
nonoperative management mortality rates.

Aldrian et al. conducted a retrospective chart review on 46 patients to evaluate outcomes
following surgical or nonoperative treatment of Hadley type IIA odontoid fractures. Authors
conclude following nonoperative management, Hadley type IIA odontoid fractures are
associated with increased risk for secondary loss of reduction and bony nonunion.

fusion techniques offer comparable clinical outcomes.

A 2023 systematic review and meta-
analysis also found no signiﬁcant difference in functional outcomes from ACDF vs. posterior
discectomy (PD) with moderate evidence per GRADE analysis.
83
The subject matter experts
summarize that an individualized approach should be tailored to the individual patient’s
pathology to determine the optimal surgical route.
A 2023 systematic review on cervical degenerative disease treatment by the Agency for
84
Healthcare Research and Quality included 57 RCTs, 56 nonrandomized studies and one
systematic review that enrolled patients with radiculopathy and/or myelopathy at one or more
levels and analyzed various surgical approaches used. They report there were few comparative
studies of non-operative treatments, and most studies were rated moderate risk of bias with
most evidence rated lower insufﬁcient strength to draw conclusions on comparative beneﬁts
and harms. They included ACDF, anterior versus posterior approach, standalone cage versus
plate and cage in ACDF, and laminoplasty versus laminotomy with fusion. They conclude there
were few differences in beneﬁts between surgical approaches and techniques for the treatment of cervical degenerative disease however there was some differences in the frequency of
adverse events for some comparison.
The Washington State Dept. of Labor & Industries’ Industrial Insurance Medical Advisory Committee (IIMAC) published a “Guideline for Diagnosis and Treatment of Cervical Radiculopathy and Myelopathy” Labor & Industries and states: “The ideal surgical approach for radiculopathy related to herniated disc remains a matter of debate. Various studies have compared the different surgery types and found no signiﬁcant difference among them. Cervical surgeries can be divided into 2 major approaches: anterior (with or without fusion) and posterior. Except for hybrid surgeries, the choice of surgical procedure is left to the discretion of the surgeon. Hybrid surgeries combine artiﬁcial disc replacements and anterior cervical discectomy with fusion at select vertebral bodies (adjacent or non-adjacent) in a single procedure. They state there is insufﬁcient evidence in medical literature to permit conclusions on its safety and efﬁcacy.”
85
North American Spine Society (NASS) Evidence-Based Clinical Guidelines on the Diagnosis and
Treatment for Cervical Radiculopathy from Degenerative Disorders agrees that there is a lack of
evidence that one surgical approach is superior. They reviewed multiple surgical approaches
and found outcomes comparable with a Grade B Recommendation.

Axial Neck Pain
Background
Axial neck pain is a prevalent condition that causes signiﬁcant morbidity and productivity
loss.
86
Nonspeciﬁc (primary) axial neck pain is distinguished from neck pain associated with
speciﬁc causes (e.g., radiculopathy, myelopathy, stenosis, fracture). The pain distribution is
localized to the neck and immediate surrounding structures and does not involve dysfunction of
the arms, hands, ﬁngers, or other body regions. It is characterized primarily by dull, achy pain in
the nuchal region (posterior) neck.
87
The pain can sometimes travel to the base of the skull,
shoulder, or scapulae. Other symptoms may include neck stiffness, headaches, and localized
areas of muscle pain or paresthesia. Most axial neck pain is diagnosed based on ruling out

speciﬁc causes of neck pain. There is a wide range of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic
treatment options for axial neck pain. The appropriateness of surgery for axial neck pain is
uncertain.
88
The purpose of this analysis is to summarize the evidence on the impact of fusion
surgery procedures for the management of primary axial neck pain.
Literature Analysis
In a systematic review with meta-analysis, van Middelkoop, et al. (2012) identiﬁed 10 RCTs that
compared additional fusion upon anterior decompression surgical techniques. The reviewers
found there was no additional beneﬁt of fusion techniques applied within an anterior
discectomy procedure in patients with neck pain without radiculopathy on pain, recovery, and
return to work. For recovery, the pooled risk difference in the short-term follow-up was -0.06
(95% CI -0.22 to 0.10) and -0.07 (95% CI -0.14 to 0.00) in the long-term follow-up. The pooled
risk differences for pain and return to work all demonstrated no differences.
89
Riew, et al. (2010) conducted a systematic review that examined the clinical outcome in patients
undergoing ACDF for axial neck pain without radicular or myelopathic symptoms.
90
No
comparative studies were identiﬁed; however, three case series were evaluated. All studies
showed a mean improvement of pain of at least 50% approximately 4 years following surgery.
Functional outcomes improved between 32% and 52% from baseline. Most patients reported
satisfaction with surgery, 56% in one study and 79% in another. Complications varied among
studies ranging from 1% to 10% and included pseudoarthrosis (9%), nonunion and revision
(3%), and screw removal (1%). The authors concluded, “There is low evidence suggesting that
patients with axial neck pain without radicular or myelopathic symptoms may receive some
improvement in pain and function following ACDF. However, whether this beneﬁt is greater
than nontreatment or other treatments cannot be determined with the present literature.” The
authors reported several limitations in their review. These included low-quality primary study
designs (noncomparative case series), indirectness (the mean age of patients ranged from 42-
56 years) imprecise data (small sample sizes, and the proportion of patients who achieved a
clinically meaningful improvement in pain and function >30% was not reported), and
inconsistency regarding the selection of fusion levels and integrity of discs adjacent to the
operated levels, and the role of provocative testing)
As part of a Neck Pain Task Force, Carragee, et al. (2008) conducted a best-evidence synthesis
of literature from 1980 through 2006 on surgical interventions for neck pain alone in the
absence of serious pathologic disease. The reviewers found that cervical fusion for neck pain
without radiculopathy was not supported by current evidence.
91
The literature search identiﬁed
4 frequently cited studies, which were deemed to be scientiﬁcally inadmissible, pertaining to
cervical Fusion for non-radicular neck pain with only common degenerative changes.
Palit, et al. (1999) retrospectively reported on the outcomes of 38 patients out of a possible
175 subjects (22%) who underwent ACDF for neck pain and degenerative disc disease
(DDD).
92
No concurrent, historical, or retrospective controls were identiﬁed. Fusion levels
were determined by a painful and concordant response to disc injections. An unknown

number of patients were excluded by the authors or declined surgery. Some potential
patients (again, the number is unknown) were excluded because of psychological risk
factors. The number of subjects lost to follow-up or who refused follow-up was not
reported. There was no apparent standard assessment interval, and the intervals between
the surgery and the reported assessment varied widely, from 2 to 7 years. Other
interventions that the subjects might have received during this period— which could have
affected outcomes—are not reported. Of the reported cases, the mean numerical pain
rating after surgery remained greater than 4 (of 10), and the Oswestry Disability Index
score showed moderate-to-serious impairment in most of the select group of patients
followed. No neck-speciﬁc functional outcomes were assessed. Only 18 patients out of an
unknown number (between 38 and 175) who were operated on by the authors for neck
pain and degenerative disc disease said that the surgery had ‘met their expectations’.
Garvey, et al. (2002) reported on 87 of 112 (78%) retrospectively identiﬁed patients who
underwent ACDF for a diagnosis of ‘mechanical cervical spine pain’ (deﬁned by the authors
as patients who had more neck pain than arm pain).
93
Patients were evaluated 5 to 10
years after surgery. The number of patients evaluated or considered for surgery is
unknown. The selection process and screening were not detailed. Other treatments
received were not reported. The group was heterogeneous for diagnosis: an unknown
proportion of patients had some radiculopathy, radiographic instability, or cervical
deformity. The validity of the outcomes reported is uncertain. For example, it is not clear if
pain and functional impairment measurements were recorded both before and after
surgery; if validated functional assessments for neck pain were used; and whether subjects considered the occurrence of surgery to have been advantageous to their litigation claim
(78%). Only 58 of these 112 patients (52%) reported feeling ‘somewhat better’ or ‘much
better’ than they did before their surgery; only 25 patients (23%) reported feeling at least
‘somewhat satisﬁed’ with their neck condition on follow-up. The authors cited historical
controls treated by nonoperative care of neck pain alone, 21% of whom reported complete
pain relief and 49% who reported partial relief. These cited ‘control’ outcomes were similar
to the authors’ reported surgical outcomes.
Two additional studies are frequently cited to support surgical treatment of neck
pain.
94,95
Both are retrospective case series with poorly reported recruitment procedures
and follow few acceptable study design methods for outcome evaluation. For example, in
these studies surgical outcomes are based solely on surgeons’ perceptions of patient
improvement as opposed to validated outcome instruments. Simmons, et al. report that the
operating surgeon determined that 30 of 31 (97%) patients undergoing ACDF for neck pain
were “all found to have immediate lessening” of symptoms after surgery; they further state
that in every case “all pain was gone in a week after surgery”
95
This observation is unlike
any recorded by validated outcomes measures or collected by independent examiners.

go on to state, “It is well documented that neck pain without serious
underlying disease shows wide and spontaneous variations in severity and any accompanying
impairment. Thus, none of these frequently cited, uncontrolled studies can conﬁdently estimate

how much, if any, of the reported improvement was due to a surgical intervention, how much
was due to natural history, and how much might be explained by various nonspeciﬁc and
unidentiﬁed factors. Although these studies are frequently cited as demonstrating clear efﬁcacy
of cervical fusion for primary neck pain, none of these were found to be scientiﬁcally admissible
by the Neck Pain Task Force. Instead, after critical review of the methods and data we found no
clinical evidence, even in the best-known studies purporting deﬁnitive efﬁcacy, to support the
use of either cervical fusion or cervical disc arthroplasty in patients with neck pain without
radiculopathy or serious underlying pathology.”
In addition to the methodological shortcomings of these studies described by Carragee, et al.
(2008), there were further limitations. There was indirectness regarding the Medicare population
(mean ages ranged from 42 to 45 years) and the target condition, nonspeciﬁc axial neck pain,
(the study authored by Simmons, et al. included mostly [64%] of participants with speciﬁc
causes of neck pain i.e., fracture, radiculopathy, myelopathy). All the studies had small sample
sizes (n= 34-84) producing imprecise results.
In addition to these earlier primary studies, a single more recent RCT compared anterior fusion
surgery with multidisciplinary rehabilitation for the treatment of individuals who were refractory
to conservative treatment for chronic whiplash-associated disorders (WAD).
97
This study
included 49 patients (mean ages were 38 and 40 years for the surgery and rehabilitation
groups, respectively) with predominate midline neck pain, who had no neurological
abnormalities and no speciﬁc changes seen on X-ray and MRI. The primary endpoint was the
patient’s perceived change in neck pain assessed on the follow-up, using the disease-speciﬁc
Balanced Inventory for Spinal Disorders (BIS) questionnaire. Follow-up evaluations were
performed at variable time points ranging from 17 to 50 months. Analyses were performed by
intention-to-treat and per-protocol. At follow-up, 67% of the patients in the surgery group and
23% (95% CI 15 to 64) in the rehabilitation group assessed improvements in the ITT analysis.
Corresponding proportions in the per-protocol analysis were 83% and 12%, respectively. This
study was judged to have a high risk of bias due to the lack of blinding or incomplete blinding,
and the outcome measurement (self-reported change in pain perception) was likely to be
inﬂuenced by the lack of blinding. Additionally, there was very serious indirectness (all
participants had neck pain caused by a motor vehicle accident and the mean ages were well
below the Medicare population), and imprecision (small sample size and wide conﬁdence
intervals suggesting variable effects).
Taking into consideration all the relevant studies, the certainty of evidence was judged to be
very low due to study design and execution limitations, indirectness, and imprecision.
Appropriate Use Criteria/Coverage Recommendations
The North American Spine Society (NASS) assessed the appropriateness of cervical fusion for
axial neck pain without stenosis and concluded that the surgical procedure was never
considered appropriate.
98
The authors additionally commented, “There was a trend to be rarely
appropriate for 2 or greater level fusions, whereas there was more uncertainty for 1 level

fusions. Although uncertain, anterior procedures were overall favored over posterior or anterior
and posterior procedures.”
3
In the 2023 NASS Coverage Recommendations ), the committee states “Concerning the scenarios in which cervical fusion is not indicated, recent evidence-based medicine reviews
have concluded that there is little to no evidence that fusion is an effective treatment for axial
neck pain without neurological symptoms.”
3
Evidence-based, clinical practice decision-support guidance explicitly does not recommend
surgical intervention for the management of non-radicular neck pain in adults due to a lack of
high-quality data demonstrating beneﬁt and the possible risk of harm.
99
Analysis of Evidence (Rationale for Determination)
Cervical fusion alone or in combination with other spine surgical procedures is often performed
for the management of multiple spinal conditions. There are three overall categories: cervical
radiculopathy, cervical myelopathy, and unstable spine. There are multiple etiologies which can
be revealed on imaging including herniated disc, spinal stenosis, spinal degeneration, synovial
cyst and symptomatic pseudoarthrosis from non-union of prior fusion. In all cases the history,
physical exam ﬁndings and imaging must correlate with the neurological deﬁcits attributable to
the affected region of the cervical spinal cord and other causes must be excluded.
The natural disease course of cervical radiculopathy is improvement with time and conservative measures so surgical management is reserved for refractory cases or when motor weakness creates signiﬁcant functional limitations necessitating escalation of treatment. While the evidence supporting conservative therapy is low quality there are multiple RCTs and systematic review/meta-analysis as well as societal input and subject matter expert agree on a trial of conservative measures prior to surgical interventions. There is a paucity of data on how long the conservative period should be with reports ranging from 6 weeks to 3 or more months. As the data on disease course ﬁnds most improvement within the ﬁrst 3 months a 12-week trial of conservative management is established, however the policy does acknowledge the need for some patients with progression during this time to shift to surgical management.
Cervical myelopathy (degenerative and mixed) is typically treated surgically due to the higher rate of neurological symptoms and risk of progression. In mild cases resolution with conservative therapy is possible and a trial of conservative treatment is indicated with education on progressive symptoms and intervention if worsening. Guidelines consist of a 6–12- week trial and 12 weeks was selected to allow time for the natural history of resolution or progression to determine if surgical intervention is necessary. In cases where there are progressive symptoms with neurological deﬁcits surgical intervention prior to the 12-week time period can be considered.
In cases of unstable spine surgical intervention is necessary and there are few alternative options to consider. Malignant or benign spinal tumors leading to intractable pain or instability or anticipated instability due to treatment may necessitate stabilization with fusion. In some cases, spinal infection with destruction of bone and cervical kyphosis with cord compression may require surgical intervention to stabilize the spine.
There is not sufﬁcient evidence to support surgical intervention for axial neck pain. Systematic review evaluating outcome for ACDF for axial neck pain with and without radiculopathy or

myelopathy reported low quality evidence and the beneﬁt of the surgery over time could not be established as compared to nonsurgical treatment options. The remaining evidence reviewed concludes very low quality and therefore this is not considered reasonable and necessary. This is consistent with societal guidelines.
Investigation into the optimal surgical procedure has explored outcomes with various approaches. While there are clear beneﬁts and disadvantages of the various approaches the overall outcome is largely equivalent. As there is no evidence to support one surgical approach over another the decision for the optimal surgical approach is determined by the surgeon and patients with consideration of the pathology and evaluation of risk and beneﬁts of the various approaches. This is consistent with societal guidance and expert opinion.
